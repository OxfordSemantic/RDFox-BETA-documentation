RDFox Features and Requirements
===============================

RDFox Features
--------------

RDFoxÂ® provides the following main functionality:

- RDFox can import RDF triples, rules, and OWL 2 and SWRL axioms either
  programmatically or from files of certain formats (see :numref:`import` for
  details). RDF data can be validated using the SHACL constraint language.
  Additionally, RDFox can access information from external data sources, such as
  CSV files, relational databases, or Apache Solr (see :numref:`data-sources`).

- Triples, rules and axioms can be exported into a number of different formats
  (see :numref:`export` for details). Furthermore, the contents of the system
  can be incrementally saved into a binary file, which can later be loaded to
  restore the system's state.

- RDFox can answer SPARQL 1.1 queries (see :numref:`querying`) and provides
  functionality for monitoring query answering and accessing query plans.

- RDFox supports materialization-based reasoning, where all triples that
  logically follow from the facts and rules in the system are materialized as
  new triples (see :numref:`reasoning`) . Materializations can be incrementally
  updated, which means that reasoning does not need to be performed from
  scratch once the information in the system is updated. Furthermore, the
  results of reasoning can be *explained*, which means that RDFox is able to
  return proofs for any new fact added to the store through materialization.

- RDFox supports ACID transactional updates (see :numref:`transactions` for
  further details on transactions).

- Individual information elements in the system can be assigned different
  access permissions for different users (see :numref:`access-control` for
  further details on access control).

.. _software-archive:

Software Archive
----------------------

RDFox is distributed as an archive containing the following files and
directories:

- ``RDFox`` (macOS/Linux) or ``RDFox.exe`` (Windows): a stand-alone executable
  that can be used to run RDFox on the command line.

- ``lib``: a directory containing the following libraries:

   - ``JRDFox.jar``: the Java API to the RDFox engine.

   - ``libRDFox.dylib`` (macOS), ``libRDFox.so`` (Linux), or ``libRDFox.dll``
     (Windows): a dynamic/shared library that implements the C and the Java
     Native APIs of RDFox.

   - ``libRDFox.lib`` (Windows only): the import library needed for linking
     ``libRDFox.dll`` on Windows.

   - ``libRDFox-static.a`` (macOS and Linux) or ``libRDFox-static.lib``
     (Windows): a static library that implements the C API of RDFox.

- ``include``: a directory containing include files providing access to the C
  and C++ APIs.

- ``examples``: a directory containing demonstration programs that show how to
  call RDFox as a library.


   - ``C``: a directory containing a C source file demonstrating how to call
     RDFox via the experimental C API. The directory also contains scripts
     ``compile-shared-and-run.sh`` and ``compile-static-and-run.sh`` on macOS
     and Linux, and scripts ``compile-shared-and-run.bat`` and
     ``compile-static-and-run.bat`` on Windows, which can be used to build and
     run the demo. On macOS and Linux, the scripts assumes a C17 compliant
     version of gcc is available on the path. On Windows, the scripts assume
     that ``vcvars64.bat`` has been executed in the shell prior to execution.

   - ``C++``: a directory containing a C++ source file demonstrating how to use
     RDFox via the C++ API. The directory also contains scripts
     ``compile-shared-and-run.sh`` and ``compile-static-and-run.sh`` on macOS
     and Linux, and scripts ``compile-shared-and-run.bat`` and
     ``compile-static-and-run.bat`` on Windows, which can be used to build and
     run the demo. On macOS and Linux, the script assumes a version of g++
     supporting C++11 is available on the path. On Windows, the script assumes
     that ``vcvars64.bat`` has been executed in the shell prior to execution.

   - ``Java``: a directory containing source code for a program demonstrating
     how to call RDFox via the Java API. The ``examples/Java/build.xml`` Apache
     Ant script can be used to compile and run the program.

Interfaces
----------------

Users and developers can interact with RDFox through the following interfaces:

CLI
  RDFox comes with a built-in shell that can be used to interact with and
  control the RDFox Server. The shell can be launched together with an RDFox
  Server instance using the ``shell`` or ``sandbox`` modes of the executable.
  Alternatively the ``remote`` executable mode can be used to connect to and use
  the shell interface of a remote RDFox Server. See :numref:`rdfox-shell` for
  details.

RESTful API
  When RDFox's endpoint is running, clients can interact with the associated
  RDFox server via a RESTful API. For details of the RESTful API, see
  :numref:`apis`. For details of how to configure and start the
  endpoint, see :numref:`rdfox-endpoint`.

Java API
  RDFox can be embedded into Java applications and called via the Java API
  described in :numref:`apis` and :numref:`javadoc`. To use JRDFox in
  your project, simply add ``JRDFox.jar`` to your classpath, and make sure that
  the path to the dynamic library is correctly specified when starting your
  program using the following JVM option:

  ::

     -Djava.library.path=<path to the dynamic library>

C API (EXPERIMENTAL)
  RDFox can be dynamically loaded and called through a C API.

GUI
  As well as serving the REST API, the RDFox endpoint serves the RDFox Console,
  a browser-based user interface supporting basic querying and visualization of
  data store content. When the endpoint is running, the Console can be loaded by
  visiting ``http[s]:<hostname>:<port>/console/`` where ``<hostname>`` and
  ``<port>`` are the host name and port number at which the endpoint can be
  reached.

System Requirements
---------------------

Software
~~~~~~~~

Operating Systems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

RDFox supports the following operating system versions:

Windows
  Windows 10 or higher

Mac
  macOS 10.14 or higher

Linux
   - Ubuntu 18.04 or higher
   - Amazon Linux 2 or higher

Additionally, RDFox can be run using Docker. See :numref:`docker` for
details.

.. _third-party-software:

Third-party Software
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some RDFox features depend on dynamic-link libraries (DLL) from the list of the
third-party software packages below. In each case, the DLL or DLLs are loaded
on-demand the first time the dependent functionality is accessed within a
session. This means that RDFox can be deployed in the absence of these packages
if the dependent functionality is not needed.

`OpenSSL <https://www.openssl.org/>`__
  Used to implement TLS for RDFox's HTTP client and server code, as well as for
  persistence and session encryption. The search paths used to locate the DLLs
  from this package when the endpoint is starting can be specified via the
  ``RDFOX_LIBCRYPTO_PATH`` and ``RDFOX_LIBSSL_PATH`` environment variables. If
  the environment variables are not set, the default values shown in the
  following table are used.

    .. table ::
        :widths: 20,30,30

        +----------------+------------------------------+---------------------------+
        |    Platform    |     libcrypto search path    |   libssl search path      |
        +================+==============================+===========================+
        | Windows        | ``libcrypto-3-x64.dll``      | ``libssl-3-x64.dll``      |
        +----------------+------------------------------+---------------------------+
        | macOS          | ``libcrypto.3.dylib``        | ``libssl.3.dylib``        |
        +----------------+------------------------------+---------------------------+
        | Linux          | ``libcrypto.so``             | ``libssl.so``             |
        +----------------+------------------------------+---------------------------+
  
  The resolved libraries must have version v3.0.0 or higher.

`libpq <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/libpq.html>`__
  Used to access PostgreSQL data sources. The search path used to locate
  ``libpq`` when registering one of these data sources can be specified via the
  ``RDFOX_LIBPQ_PATH`` environment variable. If the environment variable is not
  set, the default value shown in the following table is used.

    .. table ::
        :widths: 20,30

        +----------------+---------------------+
        |    Platform    |  libpq search path  |
        +================+=====================+
        | Windows        | ``libpq.dll``       |
        +----------------+---------------------+
        | macOS          | ``libpq.dylib``     |
        +----------------+---------------------+
        | Linux          | ``libpq.so``        |
        +----------------+---------------------+

  The resolved library should be of a version that matches that of the
  PostgreSQL server being connected to. The current release was built and
  tested with both library and server from PostgreSQL 14, however it will also
  work with a wider range of versions, both higher and lower. Please test your
  configuration and contact OST support as needed.

`iODBC <https://www.iodbc.org/dataspace/doc/iodbc/wiki/iodbcWiki/WelcomeVisitors>`__ or `unixODBC <http://www.unixodbc.org/>`__
  Used to access external data sources via ODBC. The search path used to locate
  the DLL that will manage drivers for accessing the ODBC source can be
  specified via the ``RDFOX_ODBC_DRIVER_MANAGER_PATH`` environment variable. If
  the environment variable is not set, RDFox will attempt to use the default
  search paths shown in the following table to load unixODBC and, if that fails
  and the platform is not Windows, iODBC.

    .. table ::
        :widths: 20,30,30

        +----------------+------------------------+---------------------+
        |    Platform    |  unixODBC search path  |  iODBC search path  |
        +================+========================+=====================+
        | Windows        | ``odbc32.dll``         | (not supported)     |
        +----------------+------------------------+---------------------+
        | macOS          | ``libodbc.dylib``      | ``libiodbc.dylib``  |
        +----------------+------------------------+---------------------+
        | Linux          | ``libodbc.so``         | ``libiodbc.so``     |
        +----------------+------------------------+---------------------+

  Although iODBC can be used, unixODBC is recommended. The current release was
  built and tested with unixODBC v2.3, however it will work with a wider range
  of versions, both higher and lower. Please test your configuration and contact
  OST support as needed.

`libsqlite3 <https://www.sqlite.org/>`__
  Used to access SQLite data sources. The search path used to locate the
  SQLite library can be specified via the ``RDFOX_LIBSQLITE_PATH`` environment
  variable. If the environment variable is not set, RDFox will attempt to use
  the default search paths shown in the following table.

    .. table ::
        :widths: 20,30

        +----------------+------------------------+
        |    Platform    | libsqlite3 search path |
        +================+========================+
        | Windows        | ``libsqlite3.dll``     |
        +----------------+------------------------+
        | macOS          | ``libsqlite3.dylib``   |
        +----------------+------------------------+
        | Linux          | ``libsqlite3.so``      |
        +----------------+------------------------+

  The resolved library should be of a version that matches that of the SQLite
  file being connected to. The current release was built and tested with
  SQLite v3.49.1, however it will also work with a wider range of versions,
  both higher and lower. Please test your configuration and contact OST support
  as needed.

`Lucene <https://lucene.apache.org/>`__
  Used to access Lucene data sources. The search path used to locate the
  Lucene libraries when registering a Lucene data source can be specified via
  the server parameter ``jvm.options`` or the environment variable 
  ``RDFOX_JVM_OPTIONS``. The JVM options should include ``-Djava.class.path``
  of the required Lucene libraries. The separator between the classpath is 
  ``:`` (On Windows, ``;``). Any other JVM options can be specified as needed 
  using the ``|`` separator.
  If a Lucene data source is used with JRDFox, the required Lucene libraries
  must be included in the classpath of the JVM running JRDFox.
  The required JVM option and Lucene libraries are shown in the following table.

  .. table ::
        :widths: 25,40

        +-----------------------+----------------------------------------+
        |      JVM Option       | Lucene library search path             |
        +=======================+========================================+
        | ``-Djava.class.path`` | ``lucene-core-<version>.jar``          |
        +-----------------------+----------------------------------------+
        | ``-Djava.class.path`` | ``lucene-queryparser-<version>.jar``   |
        +-----------------------+----------------------------------------+

  The resolved libraries must have version v9.6.0 or higher.

`libjvm <https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/index.html>`__
  Used to access Lucene data sources with RDFox executable. The search path 
  used to locate the JVM library can be specified via the ``RDFOX_LIBJVM_PATH``
  environment variable. 
  This is required to embed the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) within RDFox. 
  If the environment variable is not set, RDFox will 
  attempt to use the default search paths shown in the following table.

    .. table ::
        :widths: 20,30

        +----------------+------------------------+
        |    Platform    | libjvm search path     |
        +================+========================+
        | Windows        | ``jvm.dll``            |
        +----------------+------------------------+
        | macOS          | ``libjvm.dylib``       |
        +----------------+------------------------+
        | Linux          | ``libjvm.so``          |
        +----------------+------------------------+

  The resolved library should match the version of the Java Runtime 
  Environment (JRE) in use. This release was built and tested with 
  Java 17, but it is also compatible with Java 11 or higher. 
  Please test your configuration and contact OST support if needed.

For a list of other third-party components used within RDFox, see
:ref:`acknowledgments`.

.. _rdfox-license-key:

License Key
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. Note for maintainers: the link printed by RDFox when it doesn't find a
   license points to the following section so if you change the section title
   or the name of this file, you must update the RDFox source code accordingly.

Creating an :ref:`RDFox Server <servers>` requires a time-limited license key
issued by Oxford Semantic Technologies. At server creation time, RDFox will
search the following locations, in the order shown, for the license key:

- the value of the ``license.content`` server parameter, if set

- [**RDFox executable only**] the value of the ``RDFOX_LICENSE_CONTENT``
  environment variable, if set

- the content of the file specified via the ``license.file`` server parameter,
  if set

- [**RDFox executable only**] the content of the file specified via the
  ``RDFOX_LICENSE_FILE`` environment variable, if set

- [**RDFox executable only**] the content of the file ``RDFox.lic`` in the
  directory containing the running executable, if the file exists

- the content of the file at the default value for the ``license.file`` server
  parameter, if the file exists

If a candidate key is found in one location, the remaining locations will not be
checked even if the candidate turns out to be invalid or expired. See
:numref:`server-parameters` for details of how to specify server parameters such
as ``license.content`` and ``license.file``.

Hardware
~~~~~~~~

This section describes the hardware requirements for running RDFox.

Memory
^^^^^^

RDFox is a main-memory data store and as such its performance is heavily
dependent on access to a suitable amount of memory. The amount of memory
required for a given application can be broken down into the following two
components.

  - **Fact storage cost** is the amount of memory required to store the facts
    (triples or quads) including both those imported explicitly and those added
    by materialization. This component depends on the number of facts and other
    characteristics of the data set such as how many unique resources it
    contains and the size of those resources.
  - **Operating memory cost** is the amount of memory required for operations
    such as querying, reasoning, compaction, and assorted other activities.
    This component is proportional to the fact storage cost but the exact
    proportion varies considerably with the characteristics of the
    workload.

Fact storage costs typically vary between 45 and 85 bytes per fact. One
should provision an additional 10-100% of this for operating memory costs. The
following workload characteristics will usually increase the operating memory
costs:

  - high numbers of queries evaluated concurrently with updates,
  - queries that return large result sets with the ``ORDER BY`` or ``DISTINCT``
    keywords, and
  - using large and/or complicated sets of Datalog rules.

A special case with high operating memory costs is that of HA replicas with the
``highly-available`` setting for the ``persistence.snapshot-restore-mode``
server parameter (see :numref:`server-parameters`). These should reserve
at least 100% of the fact storage cost as additional memory, as this is
required to restore the data store from a snapshot.

While the above figures can be useful to estimate the memory requirements, an
application should always be tested thoroughly to determine the actual memory
requirements.

In general, it is recommended to ensure that the complete memory requirements
of an application are met without relying on memory paging because RDFox's
performance will degrade significantly if the OS swaps the RDFox process's
memory pages in and out of disk. It can, however, be useful to enable a
suitably sized swap file to avoid RDFox processes being killed by the operating
system during compaction if memory requirements increase suddenly but
temporarily. This is relevant for all servers that perform compaction, as well
as HA replicas that restore the new snapshots and which use with the
``highly-available`` setting for the ``persistence.snapshot-restore-mode``.

Disk Space
^^^^^^^^^^

When RDFox is configured for :ref:`persistence`, data will also be saved to
disk, ready to be loaded in subsequent sessions. The underlying file system
must satisfy the system requirements documented in
:numref:`persistence-options` for the chosen persistence option, and have 40-60
bytes of disk space per triple. This includes enough space to store the data
itself and some working free space that is needed for operations such as
compaction and upgrade.

Recovering from low-memory or low-disk-space conditions can be complex, so it
is vital to monitor these metrics and take action before they become exhausted.
Regular :ref:`compaction <compaction-dead-fact-removal>` of data stores can
help minimize a server's memory and disk space usage.
