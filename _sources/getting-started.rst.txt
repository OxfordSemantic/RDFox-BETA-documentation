.. _getting-started:

Getting Started
===============

This page will guide you through running the RDFox® executable for the first
time. It is organised into one section of common setup steps, followed by three
equivalent sections demonstrating how to access RDFox's querying and reasoning
functionality through different interfaces (GUI, CLI and REST API), and finally
a section of suggestions for how to learn more. 

If you are looking to get started with the Java, or the experimental C or C++
APIs to RDFox, see instead the appropriate demo program included with each RDFox
release.

.. _setup:

Setup
-----

Before you begin, make sure that you have downloaded the latest RDFox release
for your system from `www.rdfox.com/downloads
<https://www.rdfox.com/downloads>`__ and unzipped it. This will produce a new
directory containing the RDFox executable (named ``RDFox`` on Linux and macOS,
and ``RDFox.exe`` on Windows) and some other files. The following instructions
refer to this directory as ``<working_directory>``.

You will also need to ensure that RDFox can find a
valid license key. The quickest way to do this is to add a copy of your license
key file directly to ``<working_directory>`` (see :numref:`rdfox-license-key`
for other ways). If you do not have a license key file, you can request one at
`https://www.rdfox.com/tryrdfoxforfree
<https://www.rdfox.com/tryrdfoxforfree>`__.

The following small RDF graph in `Turtle <https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/>`__
format will be used in the instructions below.

.. _data_ttl:

.. literalinclude:: data.ttl
   :language: turtle
   :linenos:


.. _has_child_dlog:

Additionally, the following Datalog file will be used to demonstrate RDFox's
reasoning capabilities.

.. literalinclude:: hasChild.dlog
   :language: text
   :linenos:

Download :download:`data.ttl <./data.ttl>` and :download:`hasChild.dlog
<./hasChild.dlog>` into ``<working_directory>``.

Next, open a terminal, change directory to ``<working_directory>``, and then
start RDFox as follows:

.. tabs::
    .. tab:: macOS/Linux

        .. code-block:: bash

            ./RDFox sandbox

    .. tab:: Windows

        .. code-block:: bash

            RDFox.exe sandbox

You should be presented with a command prompt indicating that you have an
instance of the RDFox shell awaiting input. If not, you may find `this video
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmoNFRz3-6Y>`__ demonstrating how to start the
executable on Windows and macOS, helpful. Otherwise, run the following command
to prepare for the main tutorial:

::

       endpoint start

This starts RDFox's endpoint which serves the REST API, including a SPARQL over
HTTP endpoint, and RDFox's graphical web console.

You are now ready to proceed to the tutorial. There are three versions of the
tutorial. Each follows the same workflow using a different RDFox interface. To
complete the tutorial using the web console (GUI) jump to
:numref:`tutorial-web-console-version`. To complete the tutorial using the RDFox
shell (CLI), jump to :numref:`tutorial-shell-version`. To complete the tutorial
using REST (API) jump to :numref:`tutorial-rest-ap-versioni`.

.. _tutorial-web-console-version:

Tutorial (Web Console version)
------------------------------

Ensure all steps from the :ref:`Setup <setup>` chapter have been completed
and then load the web console by pointing your browser to |console_link|.

.. |console_link| raw:: html

   <a href="http://localhost:12110/console/" target="_blank">http://localhost:12110/console/</a>
   
Creating a Data Store
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. |CreateDataStoreLanding| image:: _static/create-datastore-landing-image.png
   :height: 25
   
.. |CreateDataStore| image:: _static/create-datastore-image.png
   :height: 25

All facts and rules in RDFox live inside a *data store*. Initially no data
stores exist so we must create one before we can load any triples. To create a
data store, click |CreateDataStoreLanding| in the welcome dialog to display the data
store creation dialog. Enter ``family`` as the name and click |CreateDataStore|.

Importing Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
.. |ImportContent| image:: _static/import-content-image.png
   :height: 25
   
.. |ChooseFile| image:: _static/choose-file-image.png
   :height: 25

.. |AddContent| image:: _static/add-content-image.png
   :height: 25
   
.. |OK| image:: _static/upload-completed-image.png
   :height: 25

On successfully creating the data store, the console displays an option to
import data into the data store. Click |ImportContent| to display the "Add
content" dialog. Drag the :ref:`data.ttl <data_ttl>` file you downloaded
earlier onto the dialog. The dialog should update to show the pending import.
Toggle the "Update prefixes" switch to "on" to also load the prefixes stored
within :ref:`data.ttl <data_ttl>`. Prefixes are used to abbreviate IRIs
(internationalized URIs) so that they are easier to type in queries and other
commands. To assist in setup, RDFox adds eight default prefixes to every new
datastore (see :numref:`base-iri-and-prefixes`). Click |AddContent| to confirm
no further data files are to be added for now, in order to proceed with the
import.
   
A status report of the number of facts read (21) and added (21) to the data
store is displayed. Dismiss the report by clicking |OK|.

Running Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. |Run| image:: _static/run-image.png
   :height: 25

You are now ready to run your first query!

The newly created data store is automatically selected and so the SPARQL query
editor is enabled. `SPARQL <http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/>`__ is the
primary query language recognized by RDFox.

Run the default query, which returns all of the triples in the store, by
clicking |Run|. You should see that 21 answers were retrieved from the server
and presented in a table below the editor.

To demonstrate a simple conjunction, print each person's forename by replacing
the default query with the query below and clicking |Run| again.

::

       SELECT ?p ?n
       WHERE { 
           ?p a :Person ;
               :forename ?n
       }

Note that ``:brian`` is not returned as there is no triple to say that it is of
type ``:Person`` as required by the first part of the ``WHERE`` clause.

Inserting Data Using SPARQL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is also possible to modify the contents of the data store using SPARQL
updates. For example, make the ``:marriedTo`` relationship symmetric by running:

::

       INSERT { ?x :marriedTo ?y }
       WHERE  { ?y :marriedTo ?x }

This adds one new triple to the data store reflecting the fact that Lois is
married to Peter, which was derived from the fact that Peter is married to Lois.
Rerunning the first ``SELECT`` query should now return 22 triples. You can use
the back button in the browser to return to the original query.

Adding Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reasoning is the ability to calculate the logical consequences of applying a set
of rules to a set of facts. To illustrate how this can be useful, consider a
query to find a particular person's children. The above data has the inverse
information --- *i.e.* only ``:hasParent`` relationships --- so querying for
``:hasChild``, though more natural for this use case, will return no results.
We could remodel the data but this could make the phrasing of any queries about
parents less natural. We could add all the ``:hasChild`` relationships as new
facts in the Turtle file but the dataset would then have a bunch of redundancy
and we would need to make sure that we always add both relationships together
when we add new people to the dataset.

With reasoning we can have the best of both worlds. Keeping the original
dataset, we add a rule to state that if ``?c`` has a parent ``?p`` then ``?p``
has a child ``?c``. RDFox can then determine all of the ``:hasChild``
relationships itself --- including for any new families that we add later on.

.. |AddContentHeader| image:: _static/add-content-header-image.png
   :height: 25

RDFox uses the Datalog language for expressing rules. The rule described above
is captured in the Datalog file :ref:`hasChild.dlog <has_child_dlog>` that you
downloaded to ``<working_directory>`` earlier. Import it by clicking on the
|AddContentHeader| button in the header. In the "Add content" dialog that opens,
click |ChooseFile|, navigate to ``<working_directory>``, select ``hasChild.dlog``,
click to confirm and then click |AddContent|.

Importing this file will cause RDFox to run its reasoning algorithms, adding the
triples that result from applying the loaded rules to the loaded facts to the
data store as additional facts. Facts loaded explicitly from data are referred
to as *explicit* whereas those derived through reasoning are referred to as
*derived*. 

To check that we now have some derived triples, run the following query which
looks for any triple that uses the ``:hasChild`` predicate we introduced in the
Datalog rule:

::

       SELECT ?p ?c WHERE { ?p :hasChild ?c }

Four results are returned, all of which were added by reasoning.
    
Deleting Facts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a fact or rule that was used in the derivation of a derived triple is removed
from a data store, RDFox will also remove the derived triple. To check that this
is the case, delete the triple that says ``:stewie`` has ``:lois`` as a
parent by running:

::

       DELETE DATA { :stewie :hasParent :lois }

and then re-query the triples using the ``:hasChild`` property with:

::

       SELECT ?p ?c WHERE { ?p :hasChild ?c }

Observe that the answer ``:lois :stewie .``, which was derived from the
combination of the rule we added `and` the fact we just deleted, no longer
appears.


Exploring a Data Store
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. |Explore| image:: _static/explore-image.png
   :height: 25

.. |Update| image:: _static/ctx-update-image.png
   :height: 25

In addition to the SPARQL runner, the web console provides a way to explore the
facts in a data store visually. Click the |Explore| icon to the right of
``:peter`` where it appears in the results table to switch to begin an
exploration.

Initially, a single purple rectangle is displayed representing the node
``:peter``. The dot icon in the upper right of the purple ``peter`` node
indicates that there are links present in the data store that are not being
visualized. Right-click the node to display a context menu of the connections
between ``:peter`` and other entities in this data store. 

Select ``:gender "male"`` from “Outbound edges” and ``:lois :marriedTo`` from
“Inbound edges” as seen on the menu and click |Update|. The link to the literal
``"male"`` is displayed, as is the link from ``:lois`` to ``:peter``.

You have now completed the tutorial for the web console. Enter ``quit`` into the
RDFox shell to shut the process down then, if you would like to repeat the
tutorial using a different interface (CLI or REST API), repeat the :ref:`setup
<setup>` steps and then navigate to the appropriate section. Alternatively, see
:numref:`next-steps` for some suggested next steps.

.. _tutorial-shell-version:

Tutorial (Shell version)
------------------------

Ensure all steps from the :ref:`Setup <setup>` chapter have been completed
before proceeding.

Creating a Data Store
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All facts and rules in RDFox live inside a *data store*. Initially no data
stores exist so we must create one before we can load any triples. To create a
data store, use the ``dstore`` command as follows:

::

       dstore create family

The above command initializes our ``family`` data store. To ensure that
subsequent shell commands address our new data store, we use the ``active``
command to tell the shell to connect to the ``family`` data store when running
commands that address a data store:

::

       active family

Importing Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Import the :ref:`data.ttl <data_ttl>` file you downloaded to
``<working_directory>`` earlier with:

::

       import +p data.ttl

Using the +p option ensures the prefixes stored within the :ref:`data.ttl
<data_ttl>` file are also imported. Prefixes are used to abbreviate IRIs
(internationalized URIs) so that they are easier to type in queries and other
commands. To assist in setup, RDFox adds eight default prefixes to every new
datastore (see :numref:`base-iri-and-prefixes`).

This command should report the time taken by the import and that 21 data items
were processed and updated.

Running Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, RDFox does not specify where query answers must be sent. To
instruct RDFox to print answers to the terminal, run the following command:

::

       set output out

You are now ready to run your first query!

The primary query language recognized by RDFox is `SPARQL
<http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/>`__. SPARQL queries can be typed or
pasted directly into the shell.

Copy and paste the following SPARQL into the shell and hit enter to print all
of the triples in the store:

::

       SELECT ?S ?P ?O WHERE { ?S ?P ?O }

You should see a few lines beginning ``@prefix`` followed by a blank line and
then the original 21 triples (facts) from ``data.ttl``. After the triples, a
summary of the number of answers returned and the time taken for the query is
printed.

To demonstrate a simple conjunction, print each person’s forename by running the
following query:

::

       SELECT ?p ?n WHERE { ?p a :Person . ?p :forename ?n }

Note that ``:brian`` is not returned as there is no triple to say that it is of
type ``:Person`` as required by the first part of the ``where`` clause.

Inserting Data Using SPARQL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is also possible to modify the contents of the data store using SPARQL
updates. For example, make the ``:marriedTo`` relationship symmetric by running:

::

       INSERT { ?x :marriedTo ?y } \
       WHERE  { ?y :marriedTo ?x }

This adds one new triple to the data store reflecting the fact that Lois is
married to Peter, which was derived from the fact that Peter is married to Lois.
Rerunning the first ``SELECT`` query should now return 22 triples. You can use
the up arrow key to step back through your command history to find the original
query.

Adding Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reasoning is the ability to calculate the logical consequences of applying a set
of rules to a set of facts. To illustrate how this can be useful, consider a
query to find a particular person's children. The above data has the opposite
information --- *i.e.* only ``:hasParent`` relationships --- so querying for
``:hasChild``, though more natural for this use case, will turn up no results.
We could remodel the data but this could make the phrasing of any queries about
parents less natural. We could add all the ``:hasChild`` relationships as new
facts in the Turtle file but the dataset would then have a bunch of redundancy
and we would need to make sure that we always add both relationships together
when we add new people to the dataset.

With reasoning we can have the best of both worlds. Keeping the original
dataset, we add a rule to state that if ``?c`` has a parent ``?p`` then ``?p``
has a child ``?c``. RDFox can then determine all of the ``:hasChild``
relationships itself --- including for any new families that we add later on.

RDFox uses the Datalog language for expressing rules. The rule described above
is captured in the Datalog file :ref:`hasChild.dlog <has_child_dlog>` that you
downloaded to ``<working_directory>`` earlier. Import it with:

::

       import hasChild.dlog

Importing this file will cause RDFox to run its reasoning algorithms, adding the
triples that result from applying the loaded rules to the loaded facts to the
data store as additional facts. Facts loaded explicitly from data are referred
to as *explicit* whereas those derived through reasoning are referred to as
*derived*. 

To check that we now have some derived triples, run the following query which
looks for any triple that uses the ``:hasChild`` predicate we introduced in the
Datalog rule:

::

       SELECT ?p ?c WHERE { ?p :hasChild ?c }

Four results are returned, all of which were added by reasoning.

Deleting Facts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a fact or rule that was used in the derivation of a derived triple is removed
from a data store, RDFox will also remove the derived triple. To check that this
is the case, delete the triple that says ``:stewie`` has ``:lois`` as a
parent by running:

::

       DELETE DATA { :stewie :hasParent :lois }

and then requery the triples using the ``:hasChild`` property with:

::

       SELECT ?p ?c WHERE { ?p :hasChild ?c }

Observe that the answer ``:lois :stewie .``, which was derived from the
combination of the rule we added `and` the fact we just deleted, no longer
appears.

Stopping and Restarting RDFox
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Shut down RDFox by typing the ``quit`` command. Since RDFox is an in-memory
database, and because we started the process using the ``sandbox`` command
which disables any form of persistence, the contents of the data store will be
dropped when the process exits. While experimenting with RDFox, it may
therefore be useful to write the commands to initialize the data store and load
data into a script which can be passed to RDFox at startup. The following
script repeats the whole of this tutorial. Save it to a new file
``<working_directory>/start.rdfox`` and then run it with ``./RDFox sandbox .
start`` (on Linux or Mac) or ``RDFox.exe sandbox . start`` (on
Windows).

::

       endpoint start
       dstore create family
       active family
       import +p data.ttl
       set output out
       SELECT ?S ?P ?O WHERE { ?S ?P ?O }
       SELECT ?p ?n WHERE { ?p rdf:type :Person . ?p :forename ?n }
       INSERT { ?x :marriedTo ?y } WHERE { ?y :marriedTo ?x }
       import hasChild.dlog
       SELECT ?p ?c WHERE { ?p :hasChild ?c }
       DELETE DATA { :stewie :hasParent :lois }
       SELECT ?p ?c WHERE { ?p :hasChild ?c }

For alternative ways of starting RDFox which do not disable persistence, see
:numref:`rdfox-executable`.

You have now completed the tutorial with the RDFox shell. Enter ``quit`` to shut
the process down again then, if you would like to repeat the tutorial using a
different interface (GUI or REST API), repeat the :ref:`setup <setup>` steps and
then navigate to the appropriate section.


.. _tutorial-rest-ap-versioni:

Tutorial (REST version)
-----------------------

Ensure all steps from the :ref:`Setup <setup>` chapter have been completed
before proceeding.

The steps in this section use the cURL tool which is normally installed on
MacOS, Linux and modern versions of Windows. You will need to open a new shell
to run the cURL commands in addition to the shell where RDFox is running.
Inside the new shell, change directory to ``<working_directory>`` so that the
relative paths in the examples correctly locate the files you downloaded in the
setup steps.

At the end of this section, we give an example of achieving the same results
:ref:`using Python <python_rest>`.

Creating a Data Store
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All facts and rules in RDFox live inside a *data store*. Initially no data
stores exist so we must create one before we can load any triples. To create a
data store, issue a POST request to path ``datastores/<data-store-name>`` such
as:

.. code:: bash

   curl -i -X POST localhost:12110/datastores/family

Note we run cURL with the ``-i`` option to *include* the response headers in
the output which means the output will be similar to:

.. code:: http

   HTTP/1.1 201 Created
   Date: Wed, 13 Jul 2022 15:39:06 GMT
   Server: RDFox Endpoint
   ETag: "09649913528177635553-1"
   Location: /datastores/family
   Content-Length: 0

Importing Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Import the :ref:`data.ttl <data_ttl>` file you downloaded to
``<working_directory>`` earlier, into the data store created above by issuing a
PATCH request to path ``datastores/family/content`` path:

.. code:: bash

   curl -i -X PATCH "localhost:12110/datastores/family/content?operation=add-content-update-prefixes" -H "Content-Type:" -T data.ttl

This sends the content of the file to RDFox and reports success with:

.. code:: http

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Date: Wed, 13 Jul 2022 15:40:02 GMT
   Server: RDFox Endpoint
   ETag: "09649913528177635553-2"

   information: #processed-rules = 0
   information: #changed-rules = 0
   information: #processed-axioms = 0
   information: #changed-axioms = 0

Note the use of ``-H "Content-Type:"`` in the cURL command. By default, cURL
will set the content type to ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` which is a
not a supported RDFox ``Content-Type``. Using ``-H "Content-Type:"`` instructs
cURL not to set the ``Content-Type`` and allows RDFox to automatically detect
that we have data in Turtle format. Alternatively, we could explicitly set the
type using ``-H "Content-Type: text/turtle"``. For the different formats
supported by RDFox for encoding data store content, see
:numref:`data-store-content-formats`.

Including ``operation=add-content-update-prefixes`` ensures the prefixes stored
within the :ref:`data.ttl <data_ttl>` file are also imported. Prefixes are used
to abbreviate IRIs (internationalized URIs) so that they are easier to type in
queries and other commands. To assist in setup, RDFox adds eight default
prefixes to every new datastore (see :numref:`base-iri-and-prefixes`).

Running Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You are now ready to run your first query!

The primary query language recognized by RDFox is `SPARQL
<http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/>`__. RDFox exposes a fully compliant
SPARQL-over-HTTP endpoint at path ``/datastores/<data-store-name>/sparql``. To
run a query we send a ``POST`` request to this path and set the ``query``
parameter to a SPARQL query. 

Run the following cURL command to retrieve all of the triples in the store:

.. code:: bash

   curl -i -X POST localhost:12110/datastores/family/sparql \
        -H "Accept: application/x.sparql-results+turtle-abbrev" \
        -d "query=SELECT ?S ?P ?O WHERE { ?S ?P ?O }"

After the HTTP response headers you should see a few lines beginning ``@prefix``
followed by a blank line and then the original 21 triples (facts) from
``data.ttl`` in the proprietary format
``application/x.sparql-results+turtle-abbrev``. 

To demonstrate a simple conjunction, print each person's forename by running the
following cURL command:

.. code:: bash

   curl -i -X POST localhost:12110/datastores/family/sparql \
      -H "Accept: application/x.sparql-results+turtle-abbrev" \
      -d "query=SELECT ?p ?n WHERE { ?p a :Person . ?p :forename ?n }"

Note that ``:brian`` is not returned as there is no triple to say that it is of
type ``:Person`` as required by the first part of the ``where`` clause.

.. _inserting-data-using-sparql-1:

Inserting Data Using SPARQL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is also possible to modify the contents of the data store using SPARQL
updates. To run a SPARQL update via REST, we must use the ``update`` parameter
rather than the ``query`` parameter. For example, make the ``:marriedTo``
relationship symmetric by running:

.. code:: bash

   curl -i -X POST localhost:12110/datastores/family/sparql \
      -d "update=INSERT { ?x :marriedTo ?y } WHERE { ?y :marriedTo ?x }"

this returns the no content (204) status code to indicate success:

.. code:: http

   HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
   Date: Wed, 13 Jul 2022 16:53:28 GMT
   Server: RDFox Endpoint
   ETag: "09649913528177635553-3"

Adding Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~


Reasoning is the ability to calculate the logical consequences of applying a set
of rules to a set of facts. To illustrate how this can be useful, consider a
query to find a particular person's children. The above data has the opposite
information --- *i.e.* only ``:hasParent`` relationships --- so querying for
``:hasChild``, though more natural for this use case, will turn up no results.
We could remodel the data but this could make the phrasing of any queries about
parents less natural. We could add all the ``:hasChild`` relationships as new
facts in the Turtle file but the dataset would then have a bunch of redundancy
and we would need to make sure that we always add both relationships together
when we add new people to the dataset.

With reasoning we can have the best of both worlds. Keeping the original
dataset, we add a rule to state that if ``?c`` has a parent ``?p`` then ``?p``
has a child ``?c``. RDFox can then determine all of the ``:hasChild``
relationships itself --- including for any new families that we add later on.

RDFox uses the Datalog language for expressing rules. The rule described above
is captured in the Datalog file :ref:`hasChild.dlog <has_child_dlog>` that you
downloaded to ``<working_directory>`` earlier. Import it with:

.. code:: bash

   curl -i -X POST localhost:12110/datastores/family/content \
        -H "Content-Type: application/x.datalog" \
        -T hasChild.dlog

If successful, the ``200 OK`` response code should be returned.

Importing this file will cause RDFox to run its reasoning algorithms, adding the
triples that result from applying the loaded rules to the loaded facts to the
data store as additional facts. Facts loaded explicitly from data are referred
to as *explicit* whereas those derived through reasoning are referred to as
*derived*. 

To check that we now have some derived triples, run the following query which
looks for any triple that uses the ``:hasChild`` predicate we introduced in the
Datalog rule:

.. code:: bash

   curl -i -X POST localhost:12110/datastores/family/sparql \
      -H "Accept: application/x.sparql-results+turtle-abbrev" \
      -d "query=SELECT ?p ?c WHERE { ?p :hasChild ?c }"

Four results are returned, all of which were added by reasoning.

Deleting Facts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a fact or rule that was used in the derivation of a derived triple is removed
from a data store, RDFox will also remove the derived triple. To check that this
is the case, delete the triple that says ``:stewie`` has ``:lois`` as a
parent by running:

.. code:: bash

   curl -i -X POST localhost:12110/datastores/family/sparql \
      -d "update=DELETE DATA { :stewie :hasParent :lois }"

and then requery the triples using the ``:hasChild`` property with:

.. code:: bash

   curl -i -X POST localhost:12110/datastores/family/sparql \
      -H "Accept: application/x.sparql-results+turtle-abbrev" \
      -d "query=SELECT ?p ?c WHERE { ?p :hasChild ?c }"

Observe that the answer ``:lois :stewie .``, which was derived from the
combination of the rule we added `and` the fact we just deleted, no longer
appears.

.. _python_rest:

Python example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
