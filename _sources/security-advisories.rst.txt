RD-2210 - 2.3 (Low)
-------------------

A logic error in the SKOLEM built-in tuple table could allow a remotely
authenticated attacker to capture the content of memory allocated for
construction of a SKOLEM blank node identifier into the identifier itself. This
corrupts the system and, if the identifiers are formatted in query responses,
may lead to unauthorized disclosure of information depending on what data was
previously stored in the allocated memory.

To exploit this issue, one or more IRIs whose length excluding the final
segment is a multiple of 3 must be stored in the data store. An attacker with
write privileges could establish this condition and could also add the
incorrect identifiers back into the dictionary to be harvested at a later date
using rules or SPARQL updates. Once the necessary IRIs or any faulty SKOLEM
identifiers are present in the dictionary, an attacker with read privileges
could read them by querying.
