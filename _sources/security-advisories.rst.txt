Security Advisories
===================

This section documents security advisories for RDFox.

.. _security-advisories-rd-2389:

RD-2389 - 6.0 (Medium)
----------------------

RDFox's access control system allows administrators to specify which named
graphs each agent is allowed to read and write. In the versions affected by
this bug, authorization checks were not performed when RDFox's syntax
extensions for accessing tuple tables (see :numref:`querying-tuple-tables`)
were used to query the ``Quads`` tuple table where RDFox stores all named graph
facts. This would allow an attacker to read triples in any named graph even
while authenticated as an agent with no named graph access privileges.

Note that this bug affected only reading from named graphs: authorization
checks for writing to named graphs were performed correctly. Note also that, in
order to exploit this vulnerability, an agent must hold a read privilege over the
``Quads`` tuple table.

Mitigations
~~~~~~~~~~~

As an interim measure to secure sensitive data, administrators can revoke read
privileges over the ``Quads`` tuple table from any user who should not have
access to all named graphs, until they can upgrade to a fixed version.

Affected Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This issue affects all versions from 6.1 to 7.2d inclusive, 7.3 to 7.3d
inclusive, and 7.4.

.. The above information was inferred from positive identifications of the bug in RDFox v6.1 and v7.4 only.

Resolution
~~~~~~~~~~

This issue is fixed in patch releases v7.2e, v7.3e, and v7.4a. Users of the
affected versions are advised to upgrade to a fixed version as soon as possible
to prevent exploitation of this issue. Upgrading to a patched version provides
protection from this issue immediately without need for further action.

.. _security-advisories-rd-2210:

RD-2210 - 2.3 (Low)
-------------------

A logic error in the SKOLEM built-in tuple table could allow a remotely
authenticated attacker to capture the content of memory allocated for
construction of a SKOLEM blank node identifier into the identifier itself. This
corrupts the system and, if the identifiers are formatted in query responses,
may lead to unauthorized disclosure of information depending on what data was
previously stored in the allocated memory.

To exploit this issue, one or more IRIs whose length excluding the final
segment is a multiple of 3 must be stored in the data store. An attacker with
write privileges could establish this condition and could also add the
incorrect identifiers back into the dictionary to be harvested at a later date
using rules or SPARQL updates. Once the necessary IRIs or any faulty SKOLEM
identifiers are present in the dictionary, an attacker with read privileges
could read them by querying.

Mitigations
~~~~~~~~~~~

There are no advised mitigations for this issue. Please see the resolution
section below.

Affected Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This issue affects versions v7.3, v7.3a, and v7.3c.

.. The bug was identified as having been introduced in RDFox commit 9d0f1255e44af27bc81d3741611b2fa883760f20 - see comments in Jira.

Resolution
~~~~~~~~~~

This issue is fixed in v7.3d and later versions. Users of one of the affected
versions are advised to upgrade to a fixed version as soon as possible to
prevent new exploitation of this issue. After upgrading, they should also
follow the `v7.3d upgrade instructions
<https://rdfox-distribution.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/release/v7.3d/RDFox-v7.3d-upgrade-instructions.pdf>`_
to ensure that their system is free of any incorrect SKOLEM identifiers created
by this issue.
