.. _data-stores:

Data Stores
===========

As explained in :numref:`servers`, a *data store* encapsulates a unit of
logically related information. Many applications will store all of their
related data in one data store (although some applications may use more than
one data store). It is important to keep in mind that a query and rule can
operate only on one data store; thus, all information that should be queried or
reasoned within one unit should be loaded into one data store.

As explained in :numref:`servers`, a data store serves as a container for
other kinds of objects:

- *tuple tables* are data store components that store facts (see
  :numref:`tuple-tables`);

- *data sources* can be registered with a data store to access external,
  non-RDF data (see :numref:`data-sources`);

- *OWL axioms* and *Datalog rules* are used to specify rules of inference that
  are to be applied to the data loaded into the data store (see
  :numref:`reasoning`);

- *statistics modules* summarize the data loaded into a data store in a way
  that helps query planning.

The behavior of a data store can be customized using various parameters and
properties, as explained in :numref:`data-store-configuration`.

.. _operations-on-data-stores:

Operations on Data Stores
-------------------------

The following list summarizes the operations on data stores available in the
shell or via one of the available APIs.

- A data store can be *created* on a server. To create a data store, one must
  specify the data store name and zero or more :ref:`parameters
  <data-store-parameters>` expressed as key-value pairs.

- A data store can be *deleted* on the server. RDFox® allows a data store to be
  deleted only if there are no active :ref:`connections <connections>` to the
  data store.

- A data store can be *saved* to and subsequently *loaded* from a binary file.
  The file obtained in this way contains all data store content; thus, when a
  data store is loaded from a file, it is restored to exactly the same state as
  before saving. RDFox supports the following binary formats.

   - The ``standard`` format stores the data in a way that is more resilient to
     changes in RDFox implementation. This format should be used in most cases.
   - The ``raw`` format stores the data in exactly the same way as the data is
     stored in RAM. This format allows one to reconstruct the state of a data
     store exactly and is therefore useful when reporting bugs, but it is more
     likely to change between RDFox releases.

.. _organization-of-rdf-data:

Organization of Data
--------------------

The following sections explain how data is organized within a data store with
details on how the data are stored, managed, imported, and queried.

Storage
~~~~~~~

By default, two in-memory tuple tables are created automatically when a data
store is created. The first, ``DefaultTriples``, has arity three and is
designed to hold triples from an `RDF dataset's
<https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-rdf11-concepts-20140225/Overview.html#dfn-rdf-dataset>`__
default graph. The second, ``Quads``, has arity four and is designed to hold
triples from all of the RDF dataset's named graphs. If the ``default-graph-name``
(see :numref:`default-graph-name-parameter`) parameter is specified at data
store creation time, the ``DefaultTriples`` table is not created.

Importation and DELETE/INSERT Clauses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, when performing import operations or evaluating SPARQL ``DELETE``
or ``INSERT`` clauses, RDFox maps default graph triples to entries in the
``DefaultTriples`` table and named graph triples (also known as quads) to
entries in the ``Quads`` table. While named graph triples are always mapped to
the ``Quads`` table, it is possible to override the default mapping for default
graph triples so that they too are mapped to entries in the ``Quads`` table.
The exact mechanisms for doing this are described next.

For import operations, the default mapping for default graph triples can be
overridden by setting the *target default graph* parameter (see
:numref:`import-parameters`) of the operation. In this case, default graph
triples are written to the ``Quads`` table with the specified graph name. When
the target default graph parameter is not provided for the specific operation,
but the data store's ``default-graph-name`` parameter is set (see
:numref:`default-graph-name-parameter`), the data store parameter is used as
the graph name instead.

For SPARQL ``DELETE`` and ``INSERT`` clauses, overriding the default graph can
be achieved by wrapping the triple patterns in the standard syntax for named
graphs. When this syntax is not used, any setting for the
``default-graph-name`` parameter is used as the name of the graph that should
receive all default triples.

When importing rules, default graph atoms are interpreted as references to the
the ``DefaultTriples`` table unless the target default graph parameter is set
for the import or the ``default-graph-name`` parameter is set for the data
store. In the latter two cases, default graph atoms are interpreted as
references to the named graph with the specified name.

When importing OWL, all axioms are applied to the ``DefaultTriples`` table
unless the target default graph parameter is set for the import or the
``default-graph-name`` parameter is set for the data store. In the latter two
cases, axioms are instead applied to the named graph with the specified name.

Mapping Triples and Quads to RDF Datasets for SPARQL WHERE/ASK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before evaluating SPARQL ``WHERE`` clauses or ``ASK`` queries, it is necessary
to determine the RDF dataset for the query. An RDF dataset comprises exactly
one default graph plus zero or more named graphs. The default RDF dataset for
an RDFox data store contains the triples stored in the data store's
``DefaultTriples`` table in the default graph and all named graphs stored in
the data store's ``Quads`` table as its named graphs.

If the ``DefaultTriples`` table is not present when a query begins, the default
RDF dataset instead contains the multiset of all triples from the data store's
``Quads`` table in the default graph and, as above, all named graphs stored in
the data store's ``Quads`` table as its named graphs.

Regardless of whether the ``DefaultTriples`` table exists or not, the default
behaviors described above can always be overridden using either ``FROM`` and
``FROM NAMED`` clauses in the query itself or, in the case of the SPARQL
protocol, the ``default-graph-uri`` and ``named-graph-uri`` request parameters.

.. _compaction-dead-fact-removal:

Compaction and Dead Fact Removal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Facts added to any in-memory tuple table can be deleted using any of the APIs
provided by RDFox, and all facts can be removed from a data store using a
dedicated *clear* operation. Facts deleted in any of these two ways will not be
taken into account during reasoning or query evaluation. However, it is
important to bear in mind that fact deletion typically only marks the fact as
deleted and does not reclaim any resources used to store the fact. Facts that
have been marked for deletion are sometimes called *dead*, and all other facts
are called *live*. If a fact is added to a data store that already contains the
same fact marked for deletion, the fact is *resurrected* -- that is, the
deletion flag is removed and the fact becomes live. As a consequence of these
implementation choices, an application that keeps adding and deleting batches
of distinct facts will eventually run out of memory, even if the number of
facts that are live at any point in time is bounded.

Memory occupied by dead facts can be reclaimed by *compacting* a data store.
Roughly speaking, this operation removes all dead facts from memory, rebuilds
all indexes used for query evaluation, and updates all statistics used during
query planing. This operation increments the version of the data store even
though the data store content does not change conceptually. The memory used by
a data store after compaction should be roughly the same as if the data was
imported into a fresh data store. It is thus generally good practice to compact
a data store after periods of substantial data deletion.

If a data store is persistent (see :numref:`persistence`), compacting it also
saves a fresh snapshot of its entire content to disk and removes older
snapshots and deltas to free up disk space. On startup, RDFox loads data stores
by first loading their most recent snapshot and then replaying the changes in
all subsequent deltas in order. Compacting regularly helps to speed up server
restart by minimizing the number of deltas that need to be replayed after the
most recent snapshot is loaded.

Since compaction completely reorganizes the data in a data store, it can be
performed only in exclusive mode -- that is, if no readers and no writers are
active on the data store. Moreover, compaction requires reindexing the data
store, which can take considerable time if the data store contains a lot of
data. Thus, in applications where the data changes frequently, it is prudent to
schedule compaction at times of low use.

For persistent data stores, compaction will also temporarily increase the disk
usage of the volume containing the server directory by the size of the data
store's new snapshot, which must be safely written to disk before older
snapshots and deltas can be removed. Because of this, operators should ensure
that sufficient disk space is available before initiating compaction.

Because compaction can be a heavy-weight operation, particularly when a new
snapshot of the data store is saved to disk, RDFox also supports *dead fact
removal*, which can be seen as a lighter form of compaction. Unlike compaction,
it is applied only to tuple tables that contain more than 50% dead facts, and
it does not save a new snapshot of the data store. Thus, while dead fact
removal also requires exclusive access to the data store, the exclusive lock
will typically be held for shorter periods of time and so this operation is
less likely to disturb client operation, and there is no associated increase in
disk usage.

An operator can explicitly initiate data store compaction using any of the
available APIs. Moreover, RDFox can be configured to perform compaction and
dead fact removal automatically as follows.

- The ``auto-compact-after`` data store property (see
  :numref:`data-store-properties`) can be used to configure a data store to be
  automatically compacted after a fixed number of committed transactions. For
  example, if the ``auto-compact-after`` data store property is set to ``5``,
  then the data store will be compacted automatically if (a) the last
  compaction occurred at least five transactions ago and (b) no readers and no
  writers are active on the data store when the transaction is committed. If a
  reader or writer is active, compaction will be attempted when the next
  transaction is committed. This option should be used only when compaction
  overhead is unlikely to adversely affect the query and update rate of an
  RDFox instance. The default value for the ``auto-compact-after`` data store
  property is ``never`` -- that is, automatic compaction is switched off by
  default.

- If the value of the ``remove-dead-facts`` data store property (see
  :numref:`data-store-properties`) is set to ``auto``, then dead fact removal
  will be performed every time when a transaction is committed or rolled back.
  Specifically, provided that no readers and no writers are active on a data
  store at the point of commit or rollback, dead facts will be removed from
  every tuple table that contains more than 50% of dead facts. If an exclusive
  lock cannot be obtained, dead fact removal will be attempted again on the
  next commit or rollback. Dead fact removal is switched on by default as this
  should pose no problems for many applications. However, the need to acquire
  an exclusive lock can introduce an occasional slowdown in query response
  times, in which case the ``remove-dead-facts`` data store property should be
  set to ``off``.

.. _literal-data-types:

Supported Data Types for Literals
---------------------------------

As well as IRIs and blank nodes, RDFox data stores can store literal values of
the following datatypes, all of which comply fully with the `XML Schema
Datatypes 1.1 specification <https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/>`__.

+----------------------------------------------------------+

+----------------------------------------------------------+

In addition, RDFox partially supports the
`http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#unsignedLong` datatype: only the values
between zero and 9223372036854775807 are supported. This partial implementation
thus allows RDFox to import some, but not all datasets containing literals of
this datatype.

.. _data-store-configuration:

Data Store Configuration
------------------------

The behavior of a data store can be customized using options expressed as
key-value pairs. These options are arranged into the following two groups.

- *Data store parameters* are options that are set when a data store is created
  and cannot be changed subsequently. They are supplied to various APIs that
  allow data store creation, and they generally govern issues such as data
  store capacity or the persistence scheme used. Data store parameters are
  described in more detail in :numref:`data-store-parameters`.

- *Data store properties* are options that can change throughout the lifetime
  of a data store. RDFox provides various APIs for retrieving and changing data
  store properties; moreover, if a data store is persisted, any changes to data
  store properties are persisted too. Data store properties are described in
  more detail in :numref:`data-store-properties`.

.. _data-store-parameters:

Data Store Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data store parameters are key-value pairs that are determined when a data store
is created and that cannot be changed subsequently.

.. _default-graph-name-parameter:

``default-graph-name``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``default-graph-name`` option can be set to any IRI to activate RDFox's
alternative handling of default graph data. See
:numref:`organization-of-rdf-data` for a full description. By default, this
parameter is unset.

.. _equality-parameter:

``equality``
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``equality`` option determines how RDFox deals with the semantics of
equality, which is encoded using the ``owl:sameAs`` property. This option has
the following values.

- ``off``: There is no special handling of equality and the ``owl:sameAs``
  property is treated as just another property. This is the default if the
  ``equality`` option is not specified.

- ``noUNA``: The ``owl:sameAs`` property is treated as equality, and the
  *Unique Name Assumption* is not used --- that is, deriving an equality
  between two IRIs does not result in a contradiction. This is the treatment of
  equality in OWL 2 DL.

- ``UNA``: : The ``owl:sameAs`` property is treated as equality, but
  interpreted under UNA --- that is, deriving an equality between two IRIs
  results in a contradiction, and only equalities between an IRI and a blank
  node, or between two blank nodes are allowed. Thus, if a triple of the form
  ``<IRI₁, owl:sameAs, IRI₂>`` is derived, RDFox detects a clash and derives
  ``<IRI₁, rdf:type, owl:Nothing>`` and ``<IRI₂, rdf:type, owl:Nothing>``.

In all equality modes (i.e., all modes other than ``off``), distinct RDF
literals (e.g., strings, numbers, dates) are assumed to refer to distinct
objects, and so deriving an equality between the distinct literals results in a
contradiction.

**Note** RDFox will reject rules that use negation-as-failure or aggregation in
all ``equality`` modes other than ``off``.

``init-tuple-capacity``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The value of the ``init-tuple-capacity`` option is an integer that is used as a
hint to the data store specifying the number of tuples that the store will
contain. This hint is used to initialize certain data structures to the sizes
that ensure faster importation of data. The actual number of tuples that a data
store can contain is not limited by this option: RDFox will resize the data
structures as needed if this hint is exceeded.

``max-data-pool-size``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The value of the ``max-data-pool-size`` option is an integer that determines the
maximum number of bytes that RDFox can use to store resource values (e.g., IRIs
and strings). Specifying this option can reduce significantly the amount of
virtual memory that RDFox uses per data store.

``max-resource-capacity``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The value of the ``max-resource-capacity`` option is an integer that determines
the maximum number of resources that can be stored in the data store. Specifying
this option can reduce significantly the amount of virtual memory that RDFox
uses per data store.

``max-tuple-capacity``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The value of the ``max-tuple-capacity`` option is an integer that determines
the maximum number of tuples that can be stored by the in-memory tuple tables
of a data store. Specifying this option can reduce significantly the amount of
virtual memory that RDFox uses per data store.

``persistence``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``persistence`` option controls how RDFox persists data contained in a data
store. The option can be set to ``off`` to disable persistence for individual
data stores contained within a persistent server. The option can also be set to
the same value as the ``persistence`` option of the server that contains the
data store but, as this is the default value, this is not necessary.

.. _quad-table-type-option:

``quad-table-type``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``quad-table-type`` parameter determines the type of the ``Quads``
table, which is used to store named graph triples. Each option offers different
indexing strategies to optimize performance based on specific use cases.

The available options are:
- `quad-table-lg-fi` (default)
- `quad-table-lg-pi`
- `quad-table-sg-fi`
- `quad-table-sg-pi`

The ``-lg`` suffix indicates that the table is optimized for typical use cases
where named graphs contain a substantial amount of facts. In contrast, the `-sg`
suffix is suitable for rare cases where each graph consists of very few triples.

The ``-fi`` suffix denotes ``full`` indexing, providing comprehensive indexing
for efficient read and write access. Alternatively, the ``-pi`` suffix denotes
``partial`` indexing, which offers a reduced set of indexes, making it more
memory efficient.

.. _swrl-naf-option:

``swrl-negation-as-failure``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``swrl-negation-as-failure`` option determines how RDFox treats
``ObjectComplementOf`` class expressions in SWRL rules.

- ``off``. SWRL rules are interpreted under the open-world assumption and SWRL
  rules featuring ``ObjectComplementOf`` are rejected. This is the default
  value.

- ``on``. SWRL rules are interpreted under the closed-world assumption, as
  described in :numref:`swrl-naf-description`.

.. _triple-table-type-option:

``triple-table-type``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``triple-table-type`` parameter determines the type of the ``Triple`` table.
Each option offers different indexing strategies to optimize performance based
on specific use cases.

The available options are:
- `triple-table-fi` (default)
- `triple-table-pi`

The ``-fi`` suffix denotes ``full`` indexing, providing comprehensive indexing
for efficient read and write access. Alternatively, the ``-pi`` suffix denotes
``partial`` indexing, which offers a reduced set of indexes, making it more
memory efficient.

.. _data-store-type:

``type``
^^^^^^^^

The ``type`` option determines the storage scheme used by the data store. The
value determines the maximum capacity of a data store (i.e., the maximum number
of resources and/or facts), its memory footprint, and the speed with which it
can answer certain types of queries. The following data store types are
currently supported:

-  ``parallel-nn`` (default)
-  ``parallel-nw``
-  ``parallel-ww``

In suffixes ``nn``, ``nw``, and ``ww``, the first character determines whether
the system uses 32-bit (``n`` for *narrow*) or 64-bit (``w`` for *wide*)
unsigned integers for representing resource IDs, and the second character
determines whether the system uses 32-bit (``n``) or 64-bit (``w``) unsigned
integers for representing triple or quad IDs. Thus, an ``nw`` store can contain
at most 4 × 10\ :sup:`9` resources and at most 1.8 × 10\ :sup:`19` triples.

.. _data-store-properties:

Data Store Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data store properties are key-value pairs that can be modified at any point
during a data store's lifetime using any of the provided RDFox APIs (see
:numref:`apis`) or the ``dsprop`` shell command (see :numref:`dsprop-command`).

.. _auto-compact-after:

``auto-compact-after``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``auto-compact-after`` data store property determines whether and how
frequently a data store is compacted automatically. The allowed values are as
follows.

- ``never``: The data store is never compacted automatically. (However,
  compaction can be requested explicitly using any of the provided APIs.). This
  is the default.

- an integer ``n``: The data store is compacted after ``n`` transactions are
  successfully committed, provided that the data store has no active readers or
  writers at the point of commit.

.. _auto-update-statistics-mode:

``auto-update-statistics-mode``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``auto-update-statistics-mode`` data store property governs how RDFox
manages statistics about the data loaded into the system. RDFox uses these
statistics during query planning in order to identify an efficient plan, so
query performance may be suboptimal if the statistics are not up to date. The
allowed values are as follows.

- ``off``: Statistics are updated automatically only when strictly required, 
  for example after an automatic or manual compaction of the data store. They 
  can still be updated manually using the ``stats update`` command or through 
  one of the available APIs.

- ``balanced``: The cost of updating the statistics is balanced against the
  possibility of using outdated statistics. This is the default.

- ``eager``: Statistics are updated after each operation that has the potential
  to invalidate the statistics (e.g., importing data).

``base-iri``
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``base-iri`` data store property contains an IRI that is used as the base
when importing data or evaluating queries with no explicitly set base IRI. All
relative IRIs in such cases are resolved against the value of this property in
order to obtain an absolute IRI. The defalt value is
``https://rdfox.com/default-base-iri/``.

``errors-in-bind``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``errors-in-bind`` data store property governs how errors encountered
during the evaluation of ``BIND`` expressions are handled in queries. As an
example, consider SPARQL query ``SELECT ?X ?Y WHERE { BIND(2 + "a" AS ?X) . ?Y
:R ?X }``; here, the expression ``2 + "a"`` raises an error because strings
cannot be added to integers.

- If the value of ``errors-in-bind`` is equal to ``standard-compliant``, then
  variable ``?X`` is unbound after evaluating the ``BIND`` expression, and the
  query becomes equivalent to ``SELECT ?X ?Y WHERE { ?Y :R ?X }``. This is the
  default behavior.

- If the value of ``errors-in-bind`` is equal to ``skip``, then the attempt to
  bind ``?X`` to an error is skipped and the query does not return any answers.

The default behavior is compliant with the SPARQL 1.1 standard, but it can be
counterintuitive by silently accepting errors, and it can also lead to
inefficient query plans. The value of this data store property can be
overridden during query evaluation by passing the query parameter with the same
name.

.. _invalid-literal-policy-property:

``invalid-literal-policy``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``invalid-literal-policy`` data store property governs how RDFox handles
invalid literals in imported data, queries, and updates.

- ``error``: Invalid literals in the input are treated as errors, and so input
  containing such literals cannot be processed. This is the default.

- ``as-string``: During import, invalid literals are converted to string
  literals and a warning is emitted alerting the user to the fact that the
  value was converted. In queries and updates, invalid literals are converted
  to strings, but no warning is emitted.

- ``as-string-silent``: Invalid literals are converted to string literals in
  the import data, queries, and updates, but without emitting a warning.

``max-backward-chaining-depth``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``max-backward-chaining-depth`` data store property determines the
recursion depth of the backward chaining phase in the incremental reasoning
that RDFox uses to update the materialization. The value can be a nonnegative
integer, or ``unbounded`` (the default). The value of this property should be
changed only if so directed by Oxford Semantic Technologies support personnel.

``max-threads-used``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``max-threads-used`` data store property determines how many threads of the
server's thread pool this data store is allowed to use for tasks such as
importation or reasoning. The value can be a nonnegative integer, or
``all-available``; the latter is the default and it states that a data store
can use as many threads of the server's thread pool as are currently available.
Note that this doesn't affect the number of REST requests served concurrently
(see ``num-http-workers`` in :numref:`endpoint-parameters`).

``property-paths-cardinality``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``property-paths-cardinality`` data store property governs the evaluation
of property paths in queries. As an example, consider SPARQL query ``SELECT ?X
?Y WHERE { ?X :R/:S ?Y }``.

- If the value of ``property-paths-cardinality`` is equal to
  ``standard-compliant``, then the query is equivalent to ``SELECT ?X ?Y WHERE
  { ?X :R ?Z . ?Z :S ?Y }`` --- that is, the query can return the same pair of
  values for ``?X`` and ``?Y`` more than once. This is the default.

- If the value of ``property-paths-cardinality`` is equal to ``distinct``, then
  the query is equivalent to ``SELECT DISTINCT ?X ?Y WHERE { ?X :R ?Z . ?Z :S
  ?Y }`` --- that is, the query can return a pair of values for ``?X`` and
  ``?Y`` at most once.

Elimination of duplicate values is required by the standard whenever a property
path contains ``*``, ``+``, or ``?``. Thus, the ``distinct`` value for the
``property-paths-cardinality`` data store property presents a more uniform and
consistent semantics for SPARQL 1.1 property paths; moreover, complex property
paths can often be evaluated more efficiently with the ``distinct`` option. The
value of this data store property can be overridden during query evaluation by
passing the query parameter with the same name.


``query-planning-algorithms``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``query-planning-algorithms`` data store property governs which algorithms
are used to plan a query. The value of this property should be changed only if
so directed by Oxford Semantic Technologies support personnel. The value of
this data store property can be overridden during query evaluation by passing
the query parameter with the same name.

``remove-dead-facts``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``remove-dead-facts`` data store property specifies whether :ref:`dead fact
removal <compaction-dead-fact-removal>` is applied automatically after a
transaction is committed or rolled back. The allowed values are ``auto`` (the
default), and ``off``.

``query-validation``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``query-validation`` data store property specifies whether RDFox should
reject queries that conform to the SPARQL 1.1 standard in a strict sense, but
exhibit a pattern that was often found to represent a user error. The value
``standard-compliant`` instructs RDFox to closely follow the SPARQL 1.1
specification, whereas the value ``strict`` instructs RDFox to perform further
checks, some of which are listed below. The default value is ``strict``. The
value of this data store property can be overridden during query evaluation by
passing the query parameter with the same name.

The following list presents some of the types of queries that RDFox will reject
in ``strict`` mode, all of which represent common mistakes.

- Query ``SELECT * WHERE { BIND(?X + 2 AS ?Y) . ?Z :R ?X }`` will be rejected
  because, as per the SPARQL 1.1 standard, ``BIND(?X + 2 AS ?Y)`` must be
  evaluated before triple pattern ``?Z :R ?X``, and so variable ``?X`` is
  necessarily unbound when ``BIND`` is evaluated. Such a query should usually
  be written as ``SELECT * WHERE { ?Z :R ?X . BIND(?X + 2 AS ?Y) }``.

- Query ``SELECT * WHERE { ?X :R ?Y . FILTER(?Z > 2) }`` will be rejected
  because variable ``?Z`` occurs in ``FILTER(?Z > 2)``, but not in ``?X :R
  ?Y``. Variable ``?Z`` is thus necessarily unbound. Such queries usually
  contain a typo: this query was likely meant to be ``SELECT * WHERE { ?X :R ?Y
  . FILTER(?X > 2) }``.

- Query ``SELECT * WHERE { ?X :R ?Y . OPTIONAL { ?X :S ?Y . FILTER(?Z > 2) }``
  will be rejected because variable ``?Z`` in ``FILTER(?Z > 2)`` occurs in
  neither ``?X :R ?Y`` nor ``?X :S ?Y``, and so the variable is necessarily
  unbound. Such queries usually contain a typo just as in the previous item.

- Query ``SELECT * WHERE { GRAPH :G { ?S ?P ?O } }`` will be rejected if either
  the dataset does not include the named graph ``:G``, or the user does not
  have permissions to read the named graph ``:G``. SPARQL 1.1 requires such
  queries to be evaluated as if named graph ``:G`` were empty; however, this
  does not support detecting errors (e.g., if ``:G`` was mistyped in the query).

- Query ``SELECT * WHERE { ?S ?P ?O } ORDER BY ?Z`` will be rejected because
  variable ``?Z`` is used in ``ORDER BY``, but is not bound in the main part of
  the query.

- Query ``SELECT ?X ?Y WHERE { ?X :R ?Y } GROUP BY ?X`` will be rejected
  because the query uses ``GROUP BY``, but variable ``?Y`` occurs neither in
  ``GROUP BY`` nor in an aggregation function. SPARQL 1.1 standard stipulates
  that the value of ``?Y`` should be sampled in such cases --- that is the
  query should be evaluated as if it was written as ``SELECT ?X (SAMPLE(?Y1) AS
  ?Y) WHERE { ?X :R ?Y1 } GROUP BY ?X``. However, such implicit, significant
  rewriting of the query often tends to hide a typo or an omission of ``?Y``
  from ``GROUP BY``.

- Query ``SELECT ?X ?Z WHERE { ?X :R ?Y }`` will be rejected because variable
  ``?Z`` is selected, but not bound in the query. Variable ``?Z`` is thus
  necessarily unbound, which usually indicates a typo.

``user-blank-node-import-policy``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the ``user-blank-node-import-policy`` data store property is set to
``rename-apart``, then user-defined blank nodes imported from distinct files
are renamed apart during the importation process; hence, importing data
*merges* blank nodes according to the RDF specification. There is no way to
control the process of renaming blank nodes, which can be problematic in some
applications. Because of that, the default value of this option is
``keep-unchanged``, which ensures that the data is imported 'as is'. Regardless
of the state of this option, autogenerated blank nodes (i.e., blank nodes
obtained by expanding ``[]`` or ``(...)`` in Turtle files) are always renamed
apart.
