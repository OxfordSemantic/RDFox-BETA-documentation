Welcome to RDFox
================

RDFox® is a main-memory, scalable, centralized data store that allows users to
efficiently manage graph-structured data represented according to the `RDF data
model <https://www.w3.org/RDF/>`_ and query that data using the `SPARQL 1.1
query language <https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/>`__.

RDFox also enables intelligent information processing by providing means for
representing and reasoning with domain knowledge in the form of rules and
ontological axioms. Rules in RDFox can be represented using a powerful
extension of the well-understood Datalog language, whereas ontology axioms can
be represented in the standard ontology language `OWL 2
<https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/>`__ and in the `Semantic Web Rule
Language SWRL <https://www.w3.org/Submission/SWRL/>`__.

RDFox runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. It can be integrated as a library into
Java applications using an efficient native API. It can also be used as a
standalone server accessible via a RESTful API. These versatile modes of use,
combined with the very efficient storage and reasoning capabilities, make RDFox
suitable for a wide range of application scenarios.


How to Read this Documentation
------------------------------

We next provide a brief guide on how to use this documentation.

Introduction
  Sections :numref:`{number} <welcome-to-rdfox>` to :numref:`{number}
  <getting-started>` contain introductory information to help users who are new
  to RDFox.
  
  :numref:`features-and-requirements` begins with a high level description of
  RDFox's functionality then gives details of the RDFox software archive, the
  available interfaces to the system (GUI, CLI and APIs), and the software and
  hardware requirements for running RDFox. :numref:`getting-started` contains
  our *Getting Started* guide, which will walk you through your first
  experience with RDFox.

Organization of Data
  Sections :numref:`{number} <servers>` to :numref:`{number} <data-sources>`
  explain how RDFox organizes data. The information in these sections is not
  specific to any particular RDFox interface and is relevant to all users of
  the system.

  :numref:`servers` introduces the concept of the *RDFox server*, the top-level
  container for all information stored in RDFox, and the hierarchy of concepts
  used to organize that information. The parameters available for configuring
  servers are also described. The three subsequent sections provide more detail
  on the most important concepts: *data stores* in :numref:`data-stores`,
  *tuple tables* in :numref:`tuple-tables`, and *data sources* in
  :numref:`data-sources`. Finally, :numref:`connections` explains the concept
  of *connections* which are used to mediate access to the system.

Functionality
  Sections :numref:`{number} <import-and-export>` to :numref:`{number}
  <persistence>` document the core functionality of RDFox. As with the sections
  on concepts, the information in these sections is not specific to any
  particular RDFox interface and is potentially relevant to all users of the
  system, depending on the needs of their application.

  :numref:`import-and-export` describes RDFox's operations for importing and
  exporting bulk data, rules and axioms.

  :numref:`querying` describes querying in RDFox. It assumes that readers are
  familiar with the RDF 1.1 and SPARQL 1.1 standards however RDFox's
  proprietary extensions to the latter are explained in depth with examples.
  This section also contains information on how to access and visualize query
  plans in RDFox as well as how to monitor query execution.

  :numref:`reasoning` contains a comprehensive guide to RDFox's reasoning
  functionality. Unlike the section on querying, no prior knowledge of
  reasoning is assumed and the section includes many examples that you can
  readily execute using RDFox. This section also contains information on how to
  obtain explanations of facts materialized by reasoning and on how to monitor
  the reasoning process to analyze the performance of rules.
  
  :numref:`transactions` describes how RDFox uses transactions to allow many
  users to safely share a single RDFox instance. Finally,
  :numref:`access-control` introduces RDFox's access control model.

  :numref:`persistence` describes the available options for persisting the
  settings and data loaded into RDFox.

Interfaces
  Sections :numref:`{number} <connections>` to :numref:`{number} <javadoc>`
  contain reference documentation and guides for various RDFox interfaces.

  :numref:`connections` introduces the concept of *connections* which provide
  access to core RDFox functionality. Connections are used in the RDFox shell
  and all APIs so this section is useful for anyone using those interfaces.

  :numref:`rdfox-shell` describes the RDFox shell, a command line interface
  with support for both interactive and batch operation that can be used
  remotely or directly via standard input and output. :numref:`apis` contains
  the main API reference documentation for the REST and Java (JRDFox) APIs.
  :numref:`javadoc` contains a link to the full Javadoc documentation for
  JRDFox.

Operations Manual
  Sections :numref:`{number} <rdfox-executable>` to :numref:`{number} <docker>`
  constitute the operations manual for RDFox. This information is intended to
  help users responsible for establishing long-running, secure and maintainable
  RDFox deployments.

  :numref:`rdfox-executable` explains how to use the RDFox executable.
  :numref:`rdfox-endpoint` describes the RDFox Endpoint including details of
  how to start and stop it, its configuration parameters and how RDFox treats
  anonymous HTTP(S) requests. :numref:`logging` describes the types of logging
  supported by RDFox. :numref:`high-availability` gives details on how to
  deploy a group of RDFox instances to provide a single high-availability
  service. Finally, :numref:`docker` describes the official Docker images for
  RDFox.

Information
  Sections :numref:`{number} <release-notes>` and :numref:`{number}
  <acknowledgments>` contain release notes and software license acknowledgments
  for RDFox respectively.
