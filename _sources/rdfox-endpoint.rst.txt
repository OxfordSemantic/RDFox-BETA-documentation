RDFox Endpoint
==============

The RDFox® Endpoint provides REST access to the process's RDFox server (see
:numref:`servers`) and also serves the HTML, JavaScript and other static
assets for the  RDFox Console. For a description of the RDFox REST API, see
:numref:`apis`.

Starting and Stopping the Endpoint
----------------------------------

The endpoint can be started in the following ways:

-  By launching the RDFox process in ``daemon`` mode (see
   :numref:`rdfox-executable`).

-  By issuing ``endpoint start`` within the RDFox shell (see
   :numref:`endpoint-command`). When started in this manner, the endpoint
   accesses the same `RDFox server <servers>`__ as the shell, so the effects of
   any commands that affect the state of the server (e.g., ``dstore create``)
   will be immediately visible on the endpoint.

Starting the endpoint requires that at least one authentication mechanism is
configured. In practice this requires that the :ref:`authentication manager
<authentication-managers>` server parameter is not empty, or the
``request-client-certificates`` endpoint parameter is set to ``true``.

The endpoint can be stopped in the shell by issuing ``endpoint stop``. Processes
running in ``daemon`` mode (where there is no active instance of the shell) can
be stopped by sending them a ``SIGINT`` (for example with Ctrl-C) or ``SIGTERM``
signal.

.. _endpoint-parameters:

Endpoint Parameters
-------------------

The configuration of the endpoint is determined by the parameters below.

- ``port`` determines the port at which the endpoint is started. The port can
  be specified as a verbatim port number or as a `TCP service name
  <https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-por
  t-numbers.xhtml>`__. The default is ``12110``. For legacy reasons, the port
  can also be specified using ``service-name``; moreover, if both options are
  present, then ``port`` takes precedence.

- ``num-http-workers`` determines the number of threads that the endpoint will
  use to process RESTful requests. The default value is one less than the
  number of logical processors of the machine on which RDFox is run.

- ``channel-timeout`` determines the length of time that the endpoint will wait
  for I/O while servicing HTTP(S) requests. That is, if the endpoint tries to
  read from or write to the TCP connection, the respective I/O will wait for
  for the specified duration before giving up. This option ensures endpoint
  resilience in the face of slow or buggy HTTP(S) clients. See
  :numref:`specifying-durations` for the accepted values for this parameter.
  The ``unlimited`` setting may be used but should be reserved for those cases
  where there are valid reasons for I/O operations to take a long time and
  clients are known to be correct. The default value is ``60 s``.

- ``max-idle-connections`` determines the maximum number of connections to the
  server that can be idle at any point in time. Once this limit is exceeded,
  RDFox endpoint will close all idle connections (even those that have been
  idle for less than ``connection-keep-alive-time``) in order to free resources
  and thus provide uninterrupted service to users. For this option to be
  effective, it should be set to some value lower than the maximum number of
  file descriptors for the RDFox process. On Window, the default value for this
  parameter is 1024. On Linux and macOS, the default value is set to 90% of the
  maximum number of file descriptors for the server process.

- ``connection-keep-alive-time`` determines the maximum time that an HTTP
  connection will be kept open between requests. That is, if a client opens a
  TCP connection to the endpoint and makes a request, the server will wait for
  the specified amount of time to receive another request on this connection;
  if no request is issued in the specified time, the server will close the
  connection. See :numref:`specifying-durations` for the accepted values for
  this parameter. The ``unlimited`` setting may not be used. The value of ``0``
  means that the server should close the TCP connection after every request.
  The default value is ``90 s``.

- ``listening-backlog`` determines the `TCP listening backlog
  <https://www.linuxjournal.com/files/linuxjournal.com/linuxjournal/articles/023/2333/2333s2.html>`__
  for the socket accepting the connection. The default value is 10.

- ``receive-buffer`` and ``send-buffer`` determine the sizes in bytes of the
  receive and send buffers for the sockets servicing the requests. The default
  values are zero, which means that the system will determine the buffer sizes
  depending on the properties of the connection. For more information, please
  refer to the `SO_RCVBUF and SO_SNDBUF
  <http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/socket.7.html>`__ socket options.

- ``lock-timeout`` specifies the maximum time the endpoint will wait to obtain
  a lock on a data store. If the lock cannot be obtained within the specified
  time, the endpoint will return HTTP status ``423 - Locked``. See
  :numref:`specifying-durations` for the accepted values for this parameter
  which include the value ``unlimited``. The default value for this parameter
  is ``2 s``.

- ``object-keep-alive-time`` specifies the time for which the endpoint will
  keep cached cursors, connections or shells between requests. During its
  operation, the endpoint retains certain objects between requests either for
  performance reasons (e.g., the endpoint may cache cursors of partially
  evaluated queries) or to ensure its operation (e.g., the endpoint will
  maintain named server and data store connections). In order to prevent these
  objects from accumulating indefinitely, the endpoint will delete each object
  after it has not been used for the specified amount of time. See
  :numref:`specifying-durations` for the accepted values for this parameter.
  The ``unlimited`` setting may not be used. The default value for this
  parameter is ``60 s``.

- ``access-control-allow-origin`` configures the RDFox endpoint for
  *Cross-Origin Resource Sharing* (CORS). When this option is set, RDFox will
  include, in response to CORS requests, all the headers necessary to allow
  cross-origin usage of the REST API by the specified origin or origins. The
  value ``*`` can be set to allow use of the REST API by *any* origin.
  Otherwise the value should be a space-delimited list of origins such as
  ``"https://example.org http://localhost:8080"`` to allow requests from just
  those origins. When this option is unset (the default), RDFox will not add
  any CORS headers to its responses.

- ``protocol`` determines which network layer protocol the endpoint will use.

   - ``IPv4`` means the endpoint will use Internet Protocol version 4.

   - ``IPv6`` means the endpoint will use Internet Protocol version 6.

   - ``IPv6-v4`` means the endpoint will use Internet Protocol version 6 if
     possible or Internet Protocol version 4 if not. This is the default value.

- The following parameters determine the TLS configuration for the endpoint.

   - ``channel`` determines the connection type that the endpoint should use.

      - ``unsecure`` disables TLS, meaning that the endpoint will listen for
        HTTP connections (only). This is the default value.

      - ``ssl`` means the endpoint will listen for HTTPS connections (only).
        This option requires the `OpenSSL <https://www.openssl.org/>`__
        package. See :numref:`third-party-software` for more detail.

   - ``credentials`` specifies the server certificate and private key, and the
     intermediate certificates as a verbatim string in PEM format. The string
     must contain the server’s private key, the server’s certificate, and zero
     or more intermediate certificates. For example, this file could look as
     follows:

      ::

         -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
         ... server key ...
         -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
         -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
         ... server certificate ...
         -----END CERTIFICATE-----
         -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
         ... 1st intermediate certificate ...
         -----END CERTIFICATE-----
         -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
         ... 2st intermediate certificate ...
         -----END CERTIFICATE-----

   - ``credentials-file`` specifies the name of the file that contains
     the credentials. The file content must have the same format as the
     ``credentials`` parameter.

   - ``credentials-passphrase`` provides the passphrase that can be used to
     decrypt the credentials in case they are encrypted. This parameter is
     optional.

   - ``min-secure-protocol`` determines the minimum protocol version that the
     server should use. The allowed values are ``ssl3``, ``tls1``, ``tls11``,
     ``tls12``, and ``tls13``. The default value is ``tls12``.

   - ``request-client-certificates`` specifies whether the server should
     request client certificates during TLS handshakes. See
     :numref:`REST-client-certificates` for more information.

   - ``trusted-root-certificate`` specifies a Certificate Authority (CA)
     certificate that should be trusted, in PEM format. This will be used in
     addition to the default trust anchors for the loaded OpenSSL library. See
     :numref:`REST-client-certificates` for more information.

   - ``trusted-root-certificate-file`` specifies the name of a file that
     contains the trusted root certificate. The file content must have the same
     format as the ``trusted-root-certificate`` parameter.

- The following parameters determine the configuration for HTTP request logging
  (see also :numref:`request-logging`).

   - ``request-logger`` determines how each serviced HTTP request is logged.
     All logging goes to standard output.

      - ``none`` disables request logging. This is the default value.

      - ``clf`` enables request logging using the `Common Log Format
        <https://www.w3.org/Daemon/User/Config/Logging.html#common-logfile-format>`__.

      - ``elf`` enables request logging using the `Extended Log Format
        <https://www.w3.org/TR/WD-logfile.html>`__. The exact content of each
        log entry is determined by the ``elf-logger-fields`` parameter. Each
        log entry is limited to 10 KiB. Where an entry would exceed this limit,
        the elided fields are indicated with ``...``.

   - ``request-logger.destination`` determines where the request log is
     written.

      - ``stdout`` means the request log is written to standard output. This is
        the default value.

      - ``directory`` means the request log is written to a file within the
        directory identified by the ``request-logger.directory`` parameter. The
        file name is determined automatically.

   - ``request-logger.directory`` determines the directory to which the request
     log is written. This parameter has no effect unless
     ``request-logger.destination`` is set to ``directory``. If this parameter
     is unset but the RDFox server associated with the endpoint is configured
     to use a server directory, the logs will be written within the
     ``request-logs`` subdirectory of the server directory. If a directory is
     required by other settings but no directory is available, the endpoint
     will fail to start.

   - ``elf-logger-fields`` determines which fields are logged by the extended
     log format logger. This parameter has no effect unless ``request-logger``
     is set to ``elf``. The value for this parameter must be a space-delimited
     list of the following field identifiers: ``date``, ``time``,
     ``time-taken``, ``c-ip``, ``c-port``, ``cs({HEADER})``, ``cs-bytes``,
     ``cs-method``, ``cs-uri``, ``cs-uri-query``, ``cs-uri-stem``,
     ``sc({HEADER})``, ``sc-bytes``, ``sc-status``, ``x-agent-name``,
     ``x-protocol-error``. The identifier ``x-agent-name`` specifies the agent
     name with which the request was made. The identifier ``x-protocol-error``
     specifies the textual description of any exception raised due to a
     protocol error while handling an attempted request. All other identifiers
     have the meanings defined in the `draft specification
     <https://www.w3.org/TR/WD-logfile.html>`__. The default value for this
     parameter is ``date time cs-method cs-uri-stem sc-status sc-bytes
     time-taken``.

- The following parameters determine the configuration for time limits on the
  evaluation of SPARQL queries.

  - ``query-time-limit`` determines the maximum time that a request for query
    evaluation can take; if a query request is not completed in that time,
    query evaluation will be stopped. See :numref:`specifying-durations` for
    the accepted values for this parameter. The ``unlimited`` setting may be
    used. The default value is ``30 s``.
    
  - ``allow-query-time-limit-override`` is a Boolean value specifying whether a
    query request can override the time limit on query evaluation. If this
    option is set to ``true`` or ``yes``, then each query evaluation request
    can use the ``Query-Time-Limit`` header to specify the query time limit to
    be used for the current request. The value of the ``Query-Time-Limit``
    header follows the same syntax as the ``query-time-limit`` endpoint
    parameter. The default value is ``false``.

.. _specifying-endpoint-parameters:

Specifying Endpoint Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the RDFox endpoint is started for a server that is configured to use a
server directory, it will inspect that directory for a file named
``endpoint.params`` and, if the file is found, attempt to load endpoint
parameters from it. The format of the file matches that for the server
parameters file described in :numref:`server-parameters-file`.

When launching the endpoint from the RDFox shell, parameters may additionally
be set using shell variables. In this case, the parameter names should be
prefixed with ``endpoint.``. For example, to launch an endpoint listening on
port 8080, the user would issue ``set endpoint.port 8080`` before starting the
endpoint with ``endpoint start``. Parameters specified in this way take
precedence over those loaded from the endpoint parameters file.

When launching ``daemon`` processes, parameters may additionally be specified
by including them in the command line before the ``daemon`` mode specifier. In
this case, the parameter names should be prefixed with a single dash (``-``).
For example, to set the ``port`` parameter, the user might issue the following
command:

::

   RDFox -port 8080 daemon

Again, parameters specified in this way take precedence over those loaded from
the endpoint parameters file.

Changing Endpoint Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To change the configuration of the endpoint, the endpoint must be stopped and
restarted with the updated set of parameters. When the endpoint was started
from an RDFox shell, this can be achieved by first updating the endpoint
parameters file and/or relevant shell variables, and then issuing ``endpoint
stop`` followed by ``endpoint start``. When the endpoint was started in
``daemon`` mode, this can be achieved by editing the endpoint parameters file
and then sending ``SIGHUP`` to the process. Endpoint parameters that were
specified on the command line take precedence over those loaded from the
endpoint parameters file and cannot, therefore be changed in this way. Note
also that this mechanism is not available on Windows systems which lack support
for signals.

In all cases, stopping the endpoint will result in all clients being
disconnected.
