Querying
========

RDFox® supports most `SPARQL 1.1 Query Language
<https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-query-20130321/>`__ features, and it
fully supports the `SPARQL 1.1 Update Language
<https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-update-20130321/>`__. It also
implements a few proprietary built-in functions that are not part of SPARQL
1.1.

In this section, we describe in detail the support in RDFox for the `SPARQL 1.1
standard specification
<https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-overview-20130321/>`__, and the
built-in functions that are specific to RDFox.

Finally, we also describe the functionality implemented in RDFox for monitoring
query execution.

SPARQL 1.1 Support
------------------

The `SPARQL 1.1 specification
<https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-overview-20130321/>`__ provides a
suite of languages and protocols for querying and manipulating RDF graph data.

.. _query-language:

Query Language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The core of the specification is the `SPARQL 1.1 Query Language
<https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-query-20130321/>`__, which specifies
the syntax and semantics of allowed queries. The SPARQL 1.1 query language
extends the `previous version of SPARQL
<https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/>`__ with a number of important
features for applications, including nested `subqueries
<https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-query-20130321/#subqueries>`__,
`aggregation
<https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-query-20130321/#aggregates>`__,
`negation
<https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-query-20130321/#negation>`__,
`creating values by expressions
<https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-query-20130321/#assignment>`__,
`named graphs
<https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-query-20130321/#namedGraphs>`__, and
`property paths
<https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-query-20130321/#propertypaths>`__.
RDFox also implements the following
`modification to the semantics of aggregate queries with empty GROUP BY clauses
<https://afs.github.io/sparql-agg-group-empty.html>`__; this variant of the
semantics was found critical to provide intuitive answers to queries such as
``SELECT (COUNT(*) AS ?C) WHERE { ?X ?Y ?Z }`` and has been adopted by most, if
not all RDF systems on the market.

RDFox provides full support of the SPARQL 1.1 query language with the
exception of the
variant of the `BNODE function
<https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-query-20130321/#func-bnode>`__ that
takes a single string argument and the
nonnormative `DESCRIBE query form
<https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-query-20130321/#describe>`__.
The intended semantics of ``BNODE`` and ``DESCRIBE``
is, in our opinion, not sufficiently specified in the standard, which is why
those features have not yet been implemented in RDFox.

Although RDFox supports SPARQL 1.1 property paths, in many situations it might
be beneficial to use reasoning instead. This is explained further in
:numref:`representing-property-paths`

RDFox unifies the notions of ``ASK`` and ``SELECT`` queries so that both types
of query can be treated uniformly. RDFox achieves this in two steps.

* RDFox allows the ``SELECT`` clause to contain no variables; since the
  selection list is empty, such a query can return zero or more empty
  substitutions (i.e., substitutions not defining any variables). For example,
  unlike in the SPARQL 1.1 standard, query ``SELECT WHERE { ?X :name ?Y }`` is
  syntactically valid. For each triple of the form ``<a, :name, b>``, this
  query returns one empty substitution; moreover, if there are no triples of
  the form ``<a, :name, b>``, this query returns no substitutions.
  Consequently, note that the empty answer (i.e., the answer containing no
  substitutions) and the nonempty answer containing one empty substitution
  indicate different states of the RDF graph. Since such queries are not
  supported by the SPARQL 1.1 standard, RDFox is compliant with the standard on
  all queries that are valid as per the standard.

* RDFox treats a query of the form ``ASK WHERE { ... }`` as a syntactic
  abbreviation for a query of the form ``SELECT DISTINCT WHERE { ... }``. The
  latter query can either return no substitutions (which is tantamount to the
  ``ASK`` query returning ``false``), or return one empty substitution (which
  is tantamount to the ``ASK`` query returning ``true``). The answers of such
  queries (regardless of whether the query was written using ``ASK`` or
  ``SELECT DISTINCT``) are written into the respective query answer formats by
  following the rules for ``ASK`` queries. For example, the result containing
  one empty substitution is written in the ``application/sparql-results+json``
  format as ``{ "head" : { }, "boolean" : true }``.

.. _query-answer-formats:

Query Answer Formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RDFox supports the following formats for encoding the answers to SPARQL queries.

- The `SPARQL 1.1 TSV Format
  <http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-results-csv-tsv/>`__ has MIME type
  ``text/tab-separated-values``. The standard does not specify how to encode
  the answers of ``ASK`` queries in this format. As explained in
  :numref:`query-language`, a query of the form ``ASK WHERE { ... }`` is
  treated in RDFox as an abbreviation for ``SELECT DISTINCT WHERE { ... }``,
  and such queries return either no substitutions or a single empty
  substitution. RDFox will encode the answers of such queries onto the TSV
  format in a natural way: an answer containing no substitution will contain
  one empty header line, and an answer containing one empty substitution will
  contain one empty header line followed by one empty line reflecting the empty
  substitution. The header line is empty in both cases because the query
  selects no variables.

- The `SPARQL 1.1 CSV Format
  <http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-results-csv-tsv/>`__ has MIME type
  ``text/csv``. The answers to ``ASK`` and ``SELECT DISTINCT`` queries are
  encoded as in the TSV format.

- The `SPARQL 1.1 XML Format <http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-XMLres/>`__ has
  MIME type ``application/sparql-results+xml``.

- The `SPARQL 1.1 JSON Format <http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-results-json/>`__
  has MIME type ``application/sparql-results+json``.

- The proprietary format with MIME type ``application/x.sparql-results+turtle``
  outputs each query answer in a single line that resembles Turtle. If the
  query has exactly three answer variables, then query answers in this format
  can be passed to API calls that expect Turtle data.

- Proprietary formats with MIME types ``text/x.tab-separated-values-abbrev``,
  ``text/x.csv-abbrev``, ``application/x.sparql-results+xml-abbrev``,
  ``application/x.sparql-results+json-abbrev``, and
  ``application/x.sparql-results+turtle-abbrev`` follow the same structure as
  the formats mentioned above, with the difference that all IRIs are
  abbreviated using prefixes of the data store that the query was evaluated
  over. Hence, these formats provide a more user-friendly representation of
  query results.

- The proprietary format with MIME type ``application/x.sparql-results+null``
  simply discards all answers. This can be useful in situations such as query
  benchmarking, where one may want to measure the speed of query processing
  without taking into account the often considerable overhead of serializing
  query results and transporting them over the network.

- Each format from :numref:`data-store-content-formats` for
  triples/quads can be used as a query answer format for queries that return
  variables ``?S``, ``?P``, ``?O``, and optionally ``?G``. In such a case, each
  query answer is serialized as one triple/quad (where an answer is interpreted
  as a quad whenever variable ``?G`` is bound).

Update Language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RDFox fully supports the SPARQL 1.1 `update language
<https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-update-20130321/>`__. In particular,
this language allows users to insert triples into a store, delete triples from
a store, load an RDF graph into a store, clear an RDF graph in a store, create
a new RDF graph in a store, drop an RDF graph from a store, copy (move or add)
the content of one graph to another, and perform a group of update operations
as a single action.

.. _federated-queries:

Federated Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RDFox supports the ``SERVICE`` operator in SPARQL 1.1, which allows RDFox to
query remote SPARQL endpoints. The endpoint can be a RDFox server or any other
SPARQL-compliant server. Execution of a ``SERVICE`` request is performed by
sending a ``POST`` request to the path of the target SPARQL endpoint. The
following example demonstrates the use of the ``SERVICE`` operator.

.. container :: example

   **Example:** The following query retrieves all pairs of people and their
   names from a remote SPARQL endpoint, ``https://example.org/sparql``.

   ::

      SELECT ?p ?n
      WHERE {
          SERVICE <https://example.org/sparql> {
              ?p rdf:type :Person .
              ?p :forename ?n .
          }
      }

Authentication credentials can be included in the HTTP request to the target
endpoint by configuring ``http-remotes``. See :numref:`http-remotes` for
details.

.. container :: example

   **Example:** The following configuration for ``http-remotes`` enables
   sending basic authentication credentials when querying the remote SPARQL
   endpoint ``https://example.org/sparql``.

   ::

        http-remotes "{                        \
            \"https://example.org/sparql\": {  \
            \"auth\": {                        \
                \"type\": \"basic\",           \
                \"username\": \"guest\",       \
                \"password\": \"password\"     \
            },                                 \
            \"federationBatchSize\": \"512\"   \
        }"

There are some restrictions on the use of the ``SERVICE`` operator in RDFox.

* `SERVICE Variables
  <https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-federated-query/#variableService>`__ are
  **not** supported.
* The endpoint IRI must be a valid IRI.
* If the query inside the ``SERVICE`` block has proprietary RDFox extensions
  (e.g., ``TT`` expressions or ``EXPLICIT``), then the remote endpoint must be
  a RDFox server.

.. _built-in-functions:

Built-In Functions
------------------

RDFox supports a wide range of built-in operators and functions that can be
used during query answering and reasoning. Concretely, RDFox supports all
`SPARQL 1.1 Functions and Operators
<https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-query-20130321/#expressions>`__, with
the exception of the variant of the `BNODE function
<https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-query-20130321/#func-bnode>`__ that
takes a single string argument, whose semantics is unclear. In addition to
that, RDFox also supports most of the `XPath and XQuery Functions and Operators
<https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions-31/>`__. Finally, RDFox also provides a
number of proprietary functions that are useful in practice.

There is a large overlap between the functions and operators defined in
SPARQL 1.1 and XPath and XQuery. As a result most functions supported by RDFox
can be accessed using their short names, as specified in SPARQL 1.1, as well as
their IRI name, as specified in XPath and XQuery. RDFox also provides a short
name for many of the XPath and XQuery functions that have no SPARQL equivalent.

RDFox often provides additional overloads for the functions and operators from
the SPARQL and the XPath and XQuery specifications, which improves usability.
So, for example, one can extract the year of an ``xsd:gYearMonth`` value, and
can also compare without restrictions two ``xsd:duration`` values according to
the partial order on durations. All such extensions are documented where the
respective functions and operators are introduced.

A full list of the RDFox built-in functions and operators is given in the
following sections. Functions will be presented with all their available names.
If present, short names will precede the IRI names. If a function name is part
of the SPARQL 1.1 specification or the XPath and XQuery specification, the name
will be given as a link pointing to the respective part of the specification.
We will assume the following prefix definitions.

.. list-table:: XPath/XQuery Function Name Prefixes
    :align: center
    :widths: 10 40

    * - ``xsd:``
      - ``<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>``

    * - ``math:``
      - ``<http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math#>``


All RDFox functions and operators can be used in SPARQL queries. Furthermore,
all RDFox functions and operators can also be used in rules, with the exception
of ``NOW``, ``RAND``, ``UUID``, and ``STRUUID``, whose values are not
determined by their arguments.

Operators
~~~~~~~~~

The RDFox operators are listed in the following table and discussed in detail
next.

.. list-table:: RDFox Operators
    :align: center

    * - ``!`` |space| unary logical-not
      - ``&&`` |space| binary logical-and
      - ``||`` |space| binary logical-or
    * - ``<=`` |space| binary less-equal-than
      - ``>=`` |space| binary greater-equal-than
      - ``=`` |space| binary equal
    * - ``<`` |space| binary less-than
      - ``>`` |space| binary greater-than
      - ``!=`` |space| binary not-equal
    * - ``+`` |space| binary add
      - ``*`` |space| binary multiply
      - ``+`` |space| unary plus
    * - ``-`` |space| binary subtract

      - ``-`` |space| unary minus
    * - ``idiv`` |space| integer division
      - ``mod`` |space| modulo operator
      -


The **Boolean operators** in RDFox are the `logical not
<https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions/#func-not>`__ ( ``!`` ), `logical and
<https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-query-20130321/#func-logical-and>`__
( ``&&`` ), and `logical or
<https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-query-20130321/#func-logical-or>`__ (
``||`` ), which behave as defined in SPARQL 1.1.

The **comparison operators** in RDFox are ``<``, ``<=``, ``=``, ``!=``, ``>=``
and ``>``. These operators have been significantly extended when compared to
the respective operators in SPARQL 1.1 and in XPath/XQuery. When compared to
SPARQL, the comparison operators in RDFox have additional overloads for all the
date/time and duration datatypes. When compared to XPath/XQuery, which also
defines such overloads, RDFox has the following differences.

* Operators ``=`` and ``!=`` are can be used to compare IRIs, blank nodes, and
  literals regardless of their type. For example, it is possible to compare an
  IRI with a blank node, or to compare two literals of different datatypes.
* In RDFox, ``xsd:duration`` values are compared according to the partial order
  defined in the `XML Schema specification
  <https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#duration-order>`__. In contrast, in
  XPath/XQuery, the operators ``<, <=, =>, >`` are only defined for the
  subtypes ``xsd:dayTimeDuration`` and ``xsd:yearMonthDuration``.
* Similarly, in RDFox date and time values are compared according to the
  partial order on dates and times defined in the `XML Schema
  <https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime-order>`__. In contrast,
  XPath/XQuery imposes various restrictions on the allowed comparisons.

The **mathematical operators** in RDFox are the unary ``+`` and ``-``
operators, and the binary addition ``+``, subtraction ``-``, multiplication
``*``, division ``/``, integer division ``idiv``, and modulo ``mod`` operators.

SPARQL 1.1 defines only a subset of the above operators and their overloads in
comparison to XPath/XQuery (e.g. ``idiv`` and ``mod`` are not in SPARQL 1.1).
RDFox extends the XPath/XQuery behavior of these operators as outlined next.

* The unary ``+`` and ``-`` operators have been extended to the datatype
  ``xsd:duration``.
* The binary subtraction operator ``-`` has been extended to all compatible
  date and time datatypes. The result of such operation is an ``xsd:duration``.
* The binary addition and subtraction operators have been extended so that
  durations can be added to and subtracted from values of any of the date and
  time datatypes.

Functions on Terms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table lists the RDF functions on terms. Most of the functions
behave as specified in SPARQL 1.1. One difference is the addition of the two
Boolean functions ``isInteger`` and ``isDecimal``. The function ``isInteger``
returns true if the argument has one of the integer datatypes, while the
``isDecimal`` function returns true if its argument is of type ``xsd:decimal``.
Another change concerns the functions ``IRI`` and ``URI``, which take an
optional second argument that specify the base against which the first argument
is resolved. If not provided, the default base is used. Furthermore, the
``BOUND`` function has been extended to operate on arbitrary expressions. The
function returns ``"true"^^xsd:boolean``, when the input expression can be
successfully evaluated. In particular, when the expression is a variable, its
evaluation succeeds when the variable is bound. Finally, function ``STREX``
extends the SPARQL function ``STR`` with the ability to compute a string
representation of arbitrary RDF terms.

of a particular type. The following table lists the constructor functions

**SEMSIM (EXPERIMENTAL)**

RDFox supports semantic similarity computation between strings using the
``SEMSIM`` function. This function takes two string arguments and returns an
``xsd:float`` value between ``-1.0`` and ``1.0``, indicating how similar the
two strings are. The similarity score is computed using an embedding model,
which can be specified using the ``RDFOX_EMBEDDING_MODEL_PATH`` environment 
variable. If no model path is set, the default embedding model provided with 
RDFox is used. The default model and embedding library are described in
:ref:`acknowledgments`.
The ``SEMSIM`` function is experimental and its behavior may change in future 
releases. Some restrictions apply when using this function as follows:

  - The maximum number of input tokens is restricted to context size of the 
    embedding model (e.g., 512 tokens for BERT-based models). For inputs 
    exceeding this limit, this function returns ``UNDEF``.
  - The performance of ``SEMSIM`` is dependent on the complexity of the
    embedding model and the size of the input strings.
  - The embedding model must be provided in 
    `GGUF <https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/gguf>`__ format.

The ``AGENT()`` Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RDFox supports a proprietary built-in function for use in audit logging:
``AGENT``. This function returns an ``xsd::string`` containing the name of the
:ref:`agent <agents>` that owns the connection on which SPARQL evaluation is
taking place.

.. _aggregate-functions:

Aggregate Functions
-------------------

Aggregate functions differ from normal functions in that they perform
computations on sets of values rather than on individual values. In SPARQL,
aggregate functions are applied either to the set of results of a given query
or to a subset of results obtained using the ``GROUP_BY`` construct. RDFox
supports the following list of aggregate functions, which includes all
aggregate functions in SPARQL 1.1.

      - Returns the first defined value of V in the set of results, if one exists, or ``UNDEF``, otherwise.

.. _querying-tuple-tables:

Querying Tuple Tables
---------------------

RDFox organizes information in a data store using tuple tables, as described in
more detail in :numref:`servers`. There are two ways of referring to tuple
tables in queries: one uses the proprietary operator ``TT`` and the other uses
the reserved IRI ``rdfox:TT``.

**Querying Tuple Tables Using** ``TT`` **Expressions**

RDFox provides a proprietary ``TT`` operator to access data stored in tuple
tables, as shown in the following example.

.. container :: example

   **Example:** Assume that a binary tuple table ``EmployeeName`` is
   mounted from an external data source (e.g., a database), and that it
   contains pairs that relate employee IDs to their names. The following query
   retrieves all pairs whose ID is contained in the ``:Manager`` class.

   ::

      SELECT ?id ?name
      WHERE {
          ?id rdf:type :Manager .
          TT EmployeeName { ?id ?name }
      }

In the above example, ``TT EmployeeName { ?id ?name }`` retrieves all pairs of
IDs and names stored in the ``EmployeeName`` tuple table. Since the tuple
table is binary, only two terms (i.e., ``?id`` and ``?name`` ) are allowed to
occur inside the ``TT`` expression. This is analogous to named graphs, where
``GRAPH :G { ?X ?Y ?Z }`` accesses all triples in a named graph ``:G``. The
difference to ``GRAPH`` expressions can be summarized as follows.

- The number of terms inside ``TT`` must match with the arity (i.e., the number
  of positions) of the tuple table.

- Each ``TT`` expression represents exactly one reference to a tuple table. For
  example, to retrieve pairs of employee IDs with the same name, one can use
  ``TT EmployeeName { ?id1 ?name } . TT EmployeeName { ?id2 ?name }``
  (whereas ``TT EmployeeName { ?id1 ?name .?id2 ?name }`` is syntactically
  invalid).

- Variables cannot be used in place of tuple table names. For example, ``TT ?T
  { ?id ?name }`` is syntactically invalid.


**Querying Tuple Tables Using** ``rdfox:TT``

The use of the proprietary operator ``TT`` is a syntactic extension of the
SPARQL language and may result in queries being rejected by third-party
libraries. To address this, RDFox provides an additional method for accessing
tuple tables, which stays within the syntactic rules of the SPARQL language.
This method specifies tuple table atoms using the reserved IRI ``rdfox:TT`` and
`RDF Collections <https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#collections>`__, as
shown in the following example.

.. container :: example

    **Example:** Consider again the tuple table ``EmployeeName``. We can
    retrieve all pairs whose ID is contained in the ``:Manager`` class using
    the following query.

    ::

        SELECT ?id ?name
        WHERE {
            ?id rdf:type :Manager .
             (?id ?name) rdfox:TT "EmployeeName"
        }

    The reserved IRI ``rdfox::TT`` links the tuple table name ``EmployeeName``
    with the tuple table arguments encoded as an `RDF Collection
    <https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#collections>`__ (i.e. ``(?id
    ?name)``).  The query can also be given in its equivalent expanded form.

    ::

        SELECT ?id ?name
        WHERE {
            ?id rdf:type :Manager .
            _:b0 rdfox:TT "EmployeeName" .
            _:b0 rdf:first ?id ;
                 rdf:rest _:b1.
            _:b1 rdf:first ?name ;
                 rdf:rest rdf:nil.
        }

In its expanded form, a tuple table atom is encoded using multiple triple
patterns and, as a result, its position in the query body may be ambiguous. To
avoid ambiguity, RDFox determines the position of the tuple table atom using
the position of the triple pattern with subject ``rdfox:TT``. In the above
example the position of the tuple table atom is determined by the position of
the triple pattern triple ``_:b0 rdfox:TT "EmployeeName" .``

The following restrictions apply to the use of ``rdfox:TT``.

- The object of the triple pattern with subject ``rdfox:TT`` should be a
  well-formed RDF collection.
- The RDF collection that encodes the tuple table arguments should be of size
  equal to the arity of the tuple table.
- Variables cannot be used in place of tuple table names. For example, the use
  of ``(?id ?name) rdfox:TT ?T`` is invalid.

Distinguishing Explicit and Derived Facts in Queries
----------------------------------------------------

As described in :numref:`reasoning`, RDFox supports reasoning, by which it can
use Datalog rules to derive additional facts from the facts explicitly given in
the input. Sometimes, it can be useful to distinguish in the query whether a
fact has been explicitly given in the input, or whether it has been derived by
a rule. To facilitate this, RDFox provides a proprietary extension of the
SPARQL 1.1 syntax. The following example demonstrates this.

.. container :: example

    **Example:** Assume that the following triples are loaded into the data store.

    ::

        :brian rdf:type :LivingThing .
        :peter rdf:type :Person .

    If the data store contains rule ``:LivingThing[?X] :- :Person[?X] .``, then
    the following triple is going to be derived.

    ::

        :peter rdf:type :LivingThing .

    The following query retrieves all facts of the form ``x rdf:type
    :LivingThing``, together with a Boolean flag which is set to ``true`` if
    the fact is explicitly given in the input.

    ::

        SELECT ?id ?e
        WHERE {
            ?id rdf:type :LivingThing EXPLICIT ?e
        }

    Our our example data, this query returns one answer where ``?id`` is mapped
    to ``:brian`` and ``?e`` is mapped to ``true``, and another answer where
    ``?id`` is mapped to ``:peter`` and ``?e`` is mapped to ``false``.

The ``TT`` pattern provides an analogous extension. Moreover, variables bound
by ``EXPLICIT`` can be used in the rest of the query like any other variable;
for example, they can be used in other triple patterns to facilitate joins.

.. container :: example

   **Example:** The query for employees from :numref:`querying-tuple-tables`
   can be modified as follows to compute the join between managers and their
   names, while requiring both facts to be either explicit or derived.

   ::

      SELECT ?id ?name
      WHERE {
          ?id rdf:type :Manager EXPLICIT ?e .
          TT EmployeeName { ?id ?name EXPLICIT ?e }
      }

Monitoring Query Evaluation
---------------------------

RDFox provides different ways of analyzing query evaluation. In particular,
users can gain access to query plans generated by the RDFox query optimizer as
well as to useful statistics about the execution of such plans.

Suppose that we initialize a data store with the example :ref:`data <data_ttl>`
from our :ref:`Getting Started <getting-started>` guide. Furthermore, consider
the SPARQL query

::

    SELECT ?p ?n WHERE { ?p rdf:type :Person . ?p :forename ?n. ?p :hasParent ?z }

which returns the following four answers:

::

   :meg "Meg" .
   :stewie "Stewie" .
   :chris "Chris" .
   :meg "Meg" .

Next we discuss two ways of analyzing how RDFox evaluates the above query using
query plans and query profiling, respectively.

Query Plans
~~~~~~~~~~~

Query plans provide insights into the order in which RDFox evaluates the
different parts of the query. They are determined by the query optimizer in
RDFox based on the shape of the query and the statistical properties of the
data present in the store at the time of planning. To see the query plan that
RDFox uses to evaluate a given query, one needs to set the shell variable
``query.explain`` to ``true``, as shown next.

::

   set query.explain true

The next time we evaluate the above query, the shell will also display the
following query plan.

::

   QUERY ?p ?n                                                            QueryIterator
       PROJECT ?n ?p                      {          -->    ?n ?p }
           CONJUNCTION                    {          -->    ?n ?p ?z }    NestedIndexLoopJoinIterator
               [?p, :hasParent, ?z]       {          -->    ?p ?z }       TripleTableIterator
               [?p, rdf:type, :Person]    { ?p ?z    -->    ?p ?z }       TripleTableIterator
               [?p, :forename, ?n]        { ?p ?z    -->    ?n ?p ?z }    TripleTableIterator

The query plan is executed top-down in a depth-first-search manner and we can
think of solution variable bindings as being generated one-at-a-time. It is
useful to go in more detail through the execution of the plan for a given
solution binding.

When we first “visit” the ``PROJECT`` block, we haven’t obtained any variable
bindings yet (hence the empty space left of the “–>”symbol); in
contrast, by the time we have finished executing the subplan underneath, we
will have obtained a binding of variables ``?n`` and ``?p`` and hence an answer
to the query (as reflected on the right-hand side of the “–>” symbol).
Similarly, when we first visit the ``CONJUNCTION`` block, which performs the
join of the query, we have an empty binding and, by the time we return from it,
we will have a binding for ``?n``, ``?p`` and ``?z``. The join is performed
also top-down. First, we obtain a binding for ``?p`` and ``?z`` by matching the
triple pattern ``[?p, :hasParent, ?z]``. We then consider the second triple
pattern ``[?p, rdf:type, :Person]`` and finally the third triple pattern ``[?p,
:forename, ?n]``, which extends the binding by providing also a value for
variable ``?n``.

Let us consider a slightly more complex query, which uses the ``OPTIONAL``
operator in SPARQL.

::

    SELECT ?p ?n WHERE { ?p rdf:type :Person . ?p :hasParent ?z . OPTIONAL { ?p :forename ?n } }


RDFox will execute the following query plan:

::

   QUERY ?p ?n                                                                  QueryIterator
       PROJECT ?n ?p                          {          -->    ?p | ?n }
           OPTIONAL                           {          -->    ?p ?z | ?n }    OptionalIterator
               CONJUNCTION                    {          -->    ?p ?z }         NestedIndexLoopJoinIterator
                   [?p, :hasParent, ?z]       {          -->    ?p ?z }         TripleTableIterator
                   [?p, rdf:type, :Person]    { ?p ?z    -->    ?p ?z }         TripleTableIterator
               FILTER true
                   [?p, :forename, ?n]        { ?p ?z    -->    ?n ?p ?z }      TripleTableIterator

The important difference to notice in this plan is the use of the " \| "
symbol. The variables on the left-hand-side of “\|” are always bound by the
corresponding block, whereas those indicated on the right-hand-side may or may
not be returned.


Query Profiling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the ordering of the plan nodes of a given query specified in a
query plan, users can also obtain runtime information about the number of
operations performed on each of them. This information could be useful when
debugging potential performance issues with query evaluation.

To obtain such runtime information, one needs to enable a query profiler using
the following command.

::

   set query.monitor profile

When evaluating our original query

::

    SELECT ?p ?n WHERE { ?p rdf:type :Person . ?p :forename ?n. ?p :hasParent ?z }

with query profiler enabled, RDFox will print the following output.

::

    == QUERY EVALUATION STATISTICS ==

    =================================

The output is an enriched version of the query plan with 
sampling information of query evaluation and information about the
number of times the iterator of each plan node was accessed, i.e. was
``opened`` and ``advanced``. For example, the iterator for ``[?p, :hasParent,
?z]`` was ``opened`` once (successfully), and advanced four times (three times
successfully and once unsuccessfully), signified as ``1 / 4``. For each of the
four successful operations on the iterator of ``[?p, :hasParent, ?z]``, the
iterator for ``[?p, rdf:type, :Person]`` is ``opened`` once (each time
successfully) and advanced once (each time unsuccessfully), signified as ``4 /
4``. The statistics for the other plan nodes are determined in the same way
with the exception of the top level plan nodes. The statistics for those plan
nodes are unavailable, due to their special handling, but they can be inferred
from the number of query results: the iterators of these plan nodes are opened
once, and advanced as many times as the number of query results. In addition, 
the output contains the column sample count, which provides indication of the 
relative time spent for the evaluation of each plan node. The larger the number
of samples a plan node has, the more time has been spent on its evaluation. The
sample count column is useful for queries with non-trivial evaluation time. The
sampling frequency of the profiler is controlled by the shell parameter 
``query.profiler.sampling-frequency``.

By default, the query profiler prints statistics only once, at the end of query
evaluation. Alternatively, it can be configured to print statistics at a given
frequency using the shell variable ``log-frequency``. This can be useful when
fixing problematic queries with long evaluation times.

Access Control
--------------

Like all operations, the evaluation of SPARQL requests (i.e. queries and
updates) is subject to the rules of RDFox's access control system (see
:numref:`access-control`). When specifying access control policies at the
granularity of named graphs, it is important to be aware that triples in
unreadable named graphs are silently skipped during query evaluation. For a
more detailed explanation of this see :numref:`named-graph-access-control`.
