Import and Export
=================

In order to apply RDFox®'s querying and reasoning capabilities to a given data
set, the data must first be loaded into RDFox together with any applicable
rules and axioms. Small amounts of data may be loaded using SPARQL ``INSERT
DATA`` statements, but in most cases it is preferable to *import* the content
from one of the supported formats. Later, it may be necessary to extract
content from RDFox in one of these formats, and the most efficient way of
achieving this is to use the *export* operation. This section begins by listing
the formats supported by RDFox for import and export and then looks at the
specifics of each of these operations in turn.

.. _data-store-content-formats:

Data Store Content Formats
--------------------------

The following formats can be imported into or exported from RDFox data stores.

-  The `N-Triples <http://www.w3.org/TR/n-triples/>`__ format has MIME type
   ``application/n-triples``.

-  The `Turtle <http://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/>`__ format has MIME type
   ``text/turtle``.

-  The `N-Quads <http://www.w3.org/TR/n-quads/>`__ format has MIME type
   ``application/n-quads``.

-  The `TriG <http://www.w3.org/TR/trig/>`__ format has MIME type
   ``application/trig``.

-  The `OWL 2 Functional-Style Syntax <https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/>`__
   format has the MIME type ``text/owl-functional``.

-  RDFox supports  proprietary formats ``application/x.gen-n-triples``,
   ``text/x.gen-turtle``, ``application/x.gen-n-quads``, and
   ``application/x.gen-trig`` which extend the corresponding standard formats
   by support for generalized triples and quads (i.e., triples/quads where any
   component can be an IRI, a blank node, or a literal).

-  RDFox uses a proprietary format described in :numref:`rdfox-datalog` to
   capture datalog rules and facts. The MIME type of this format is
   ``application/x.datalog``.

.. note::

   The list of MIME types supported for import and export of data store content
   can also be viewed using the ``help`` command in the :ref:`RDFox shell
   <rdfox-shell>`.

.. _import:

Import
------

This section describes how facts, rules and axioms may be imported into RDFox
data stores. The goal is to help users understand those aspects of import
operations that are true no matter which interface (such as the RDFox shell,
REST or Java) is used. If you are looking for details of how to perform an
import using a specific interface, please refer to :numref:`import-command` for
the RDFox shell or to :numref:`APIs-managing-content` for the REST or Java
APIs. Reading this section first will help you make sense of the various
options available in those sections.

RDFox uses the concept of *domains* to segregate content according to how it
came to be present in the system. Facts are imported into the ``explicit``
:ref:`fact domain <fact-domains>`. Rules are imported into the ``user``
:ref:`rule domain <rule-domains>`.

.. _import-parameters:

Import Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes the parameters of each import operation. Other aspects
of import are determined by the configuration of the data store that is
receiving the content; for details, please refer to the data store parameters
in :numref:`data-store-parameters` whose names begin with ``import.``.

Target Default Graph
  According to the RDF 1.1 standards, an `RDF dataset
  <https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-rdf11-concepts-20140225/Overview.html#dfn-rdf-dataset>`__
  includes a *default* graph, which has no name, and zero or more named graphs.
  While only some of the formats supported by RDFox have a syntax for
  specifying named graphs, all of them have a syntax for the default graph. For
  each import operation, RDFox allows the user to specify a named graph to act
  as the default graph. For facts, this determines the graph that receives the
  imported content's default graph triples. For rules, it determines the graph
  that :ref:`default graph atoms <default-graph-atom>` refer to. For OWL
  axioms, it determines in which graph the axioms will be applied. Note that
  the data store parameter ``default-graph-name``, if set, supplies a default
  value for this import parameter. If no value is available for the target
  default graph, default graph triples are written to the data store's
  ``DefaultTriples`` tuple table if it exists or cause an error to be raise if
  not. See also :numref:`organization-of-rdf-data`.

Add or Delete
  RDFox can import content for the purpose of adding it to or deleting it from
  a data store. When content is being added, it is possible to also add any
  prefix definitions found in the content to the data store's prefixes. These
  definitions override any existing definitions where there is a conflict.

Content Sources
  For each import operation, the source or sources of the content to add or
  delete must be specified. All interfaces provide ways to supply the content
  directly, or as a list of file paths or URLs. Please refer to the
  ``allowed-url-schemes-on-import`` and ``sandbox-directory`` :ref:`server parameters
  <server-parameters>` that, for security purposes, restrict the URI schemes
  and file paths that can be used in an import operation.

Content Format
  It is possible to explicitly specify the format of the content being imported
  or allow RDFox to "guess" the format by inspecting the content. When a format
  is specified using its MIME type, an error will result if the content in any
  of the specified sources does not conform to that format. If the content type
  is not specified explicitly, RDFox will try to parse the beginning of the
  content from each specified content source in each of its supported formats
  to determine which format does not result in an error, and then proceeds to
  import the content in that format.

  .. note::
      When importing data in N-Quads, the content type (``application/n-quads``)
      must be specified explicitly.

Parallelization of Imports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RDFox will always attempt to parallelize the import of facts using the
available server threads (see the :ref:`num-threads <num-threads-server-param>`
server parameter). If only one source is given, the available threads will be
divided between parsing the content and loading the parsed facts into tuple
tables. If multiple sources are given, each will be assigned to a thread that
is then responsible for both parsing and loading facts from that source.

.. _export:

Export
------

This section describes how facts, rules and axioms may be exported from RDFox
data stores. The goal is to help users understand those aspects of the export
operation which are true no matter which interface (RDFox shell, REST or Java)
is used. If you are looking for details of how to perform an export in the
RDFox shell or using an API, please refer to :numref:`export-command` or
:numref:`APIs-managing-content`, respectively. Reading this section first will
help you make sense of the various options available in those sections.

Export Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes the parameters that control the behaviour of export
operations.

Destination
  For each export operation, the user must specify the destination. All
  interfaces provide ways to either receive the content directly or specify the
  path to which RDFox should write the output file. See the
  ``sandbox-directory`` :ref:`server parameter <server-parameters>` which
  restricts, for security purposes, the file paths to which a server can write.

Content Format
  The format for the export must be specified using its MIME type. Some
  interfaces satisfy this requirement by having their own default value. The
  choice of the format determines which portion of the data store content is
  exported. For RDF formats that do not support named graphs (specifically
  Turtle, N-Triples and their generalized equivalents), only the triples from
  the default graph will be exported (exporting specific named graphs into
  these formats can be achieved using a query that has variables ``?S``,
  ``?P``, and ``?O``). For RDF formats that do support named graphs
  (specifically TriG, N-Quads and their generalized equivalents), both the
  default graph triples and named-graph quads are exported. If the Datalog
  format is specified, the data store's rules are exported. If OWL 2
  Functional-Style syntax is specified, the data store's axioms are exported.

Fact or Rule Domain
  RDFox supports restricting imports by fact or rule domain. When exporting
  RDF, the triples or quads from the ``explicit`` domain are exported by
  default. This can be overridden by specifying a single fact domain. When
  exporting Datalog, the rules from the ``user`` domain are exported by default
  but this can be overridden by specifying a space-separated list of rule
  domains.

Access Control
--------------

Like all operations, import and export are subject to the rules of RDFox's
access control system (see :numref:`access-control`). When specifying access
control policies at the granularity of named graphs, it is important to be
aware that triples in unreadable named graphs are silently skipped during
export. For a more detailed explanation of this see
:numref:`named-graph-access-control`.
