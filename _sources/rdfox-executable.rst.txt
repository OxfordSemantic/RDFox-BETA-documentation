RDFox Executable
================

The RDFox® executable is a command-line tool that can be used to initialize and
launch local RDFox servers, manage background RDFox services, and connect to
remote RDFox servers for shell access. These capabilities are provided by a
number of different modes of operation, each of which is documented in the
following sub-sections. In each case the purpose, syntax, and functionality of
the mode in question are explained and examples of its use are provided.

In what follows, the placeholder ``<serverParameter>`` is used to denote one
the server parameters described in :numref:`server-parameters`,
``<endpointParameter>`` is used to denote one of the endpoint parameters
described in :numref:`endpoint-parameters`, ``<role>`` and ``<password>`` are
used to denote a role name and corresponding password, ``<root>`` is used to
denote the root directory for the RDFox shell, and ``<command>`` is used to
denote one of the RDFox shell commands described in :numref:`shell-commands`.
All modes that accept ``-role`` and ``-password`` options, also allow the role
and password to be specified via the ``RDFOX_ROLE`` and ``RDFOX_PASSWORD``
environment variables instead. When both the command line option and the
corresponding environment variable are specified, the command line option takes
precedence.

Several modes set a default value for the ``server-directory`` server parameter
if it is not specified explicitly. This is ``$HOME/.RDFox`` on Linux and macOS
and ``$LOCALAPPDATA\RDFox`` on Windows.

``sandbox``
~~~~~~~~~~~

``sandbox`` mode is provided to allow users to quickly start in-memory RDFox
servers for command line and, optionally, REST interaction, with defaults
suitable for testing and development. The syntax for this mode is:

::

   RDFox [-<serverParameter> <value> ...] [-<endpointParameter> <value> ...] [-role <role>] [-password <password>] sandbox [<root> [<command> ...]]

This instantiates an in-memory RDFox server with an interactive shell and the
following server parameters, which are aimed at making it convenient for use in
development and testing:

- The ``server-directory`` parameter is left unset to guarantee that RDFox
  servers launched in this mode cannot affect any persisted settings or
  content.

- Filesystem sandboxing is disabled by setting the ``sandbox-directory``
  parameter to the empty string. This ensures that the server can access any
  files on the host system (subject to the OS's file permissions).

- The ``allowed-schemes-on-load`` parameter is set to include all supported URL
  schemes so that the server can load resources with any of these schemes.

In addition the role and password are both defaulted to ``guest``. This allows
full control of the system via the REST API without authentication, if the
endpoint is later started with the shell command ``endpoint start``. To allow
flexibility, the role and password can be set explicitly along with any server
parameters other than those mentioned above, and all endpoint parameters. The
syntax also accepts a list of RDFox shell commands to be executed before the
command prompt is returned for interaction. These are specified after the
``sandbox`` mode specifier and a root directory for the shell.

.. container:: example

   **Example: Launching in Sandbox Mode**

   The easiest way to launch RDFox in sandbox mode is to run:

   ::

      RDFox sandbox

   It is often convenient to write an RDFox shell script to save typing.
   Assuming it's saved with name ``start.rdfox``, the above command can be
   extended to run this script as follows:

   ::

      RDFox sandbox . start

The shell can be closed by issuing the ``quit`` command.

.. _exe-mode-analyze:

``analyze``
~~~~~~~~~~~

``analyze`` mode is used to check whether a directory is ready to be used as an
RDFox server directory with the current version of the executable. The syntax
for this mode is:

::

   RDFox [-server-directory <value>] analyze

This mode will print an error and return a non-zero exit code if the specified
server directory does not exist. Otherwise, it will print a message detailing
one of the following outcomes and return a zero exit code:

  - the directory requires initialization using ``init`` mode,
  - the directory is initialized but requires upgrading using ``upgrade`` mode,
    or
  - the directory is ready to be used as a server directory with ``shell`` and
    ``daemon`` modes.

.. _exe-mode-init:

``init``
~~~~~~~~

``init`` mode initializes a persistent RDFox server. The syntax for this mode
is:

::

   RDFox [-<serverParameter> <value> ...] [-<endpointParameter> <value> ...] [-temp-role |[-role <role>] [-password <password>]] init [<root> [<command> ...]]

If the ``server-directory`` parameter is not specified in the command, the
default value for the OS user account is used (see above). If the
``persistence`` server parameter is not specified, or it is specified with
value ``off`` the process will return an error. If the ``channel`` endpoint 
parameter is not specified, the process will return an error.

A role and password are required by this mode in order to create the first
server role. If either are absent from both the command arguments and
environment variables, and the ``-temp-role`` option is not specified, RDFox
will prompt for the missing values. If the ``-temp-role`` option is specified,
a temporary role will be created with a random name and password and installed
as the first server role. The temporary role will be removed before the command
completes. This option is provided for cases when the complete access control
configuration will be established via the shell commands given at the end of
the command line, for example when initializing a server with content and
settings :ref:`transcribed <transcribe-command>` from another server.

At this point, all of the specified server and endpoint parameters are recorded
in :ref:`server <server-parameters-file>` and :ref:`endpoint
<specifying-endpoint-parameters>` parameters files in the server directory.
Next, the server's data store catalog persistence is initialized and after that
the server's access control configuration is initialized using the specified
role and password. If any of the three role manager configuration parameters
relating to password hashing (see
:numref:`role-manager-configuration-parameters`) is zero, access control
initialization will include a step to automatically determine suitable values
for all three. This usually takes a few seconds but occasionally takes several
tens of seconds. Finally, if the command line includes any shell commands these
are executed.

In the case of any error, including errors raised by shell commands, any
changes to the file system are rolled back and the process returns a non-zero
exit code. In the case of a successful initialization, the process returns
zero.

The server can now be launched in ``daemon`` or ``shell`` modes.

.. container:: example

   **Example: Initializing a Persistent Server on Linux**

   The following Bash-compatible script can be used to initialize a persistent
   server with no data stores on Linux:

   ::

      export RDFOX_PASSWORD="******"
      RDFox -server-directory /var/lib/RDFox -persistence file -role admin init

.. _exe-mode-upgrade:

``upgrade``
~~~~~~~~~~~

``upgrade`` mode upgrades a server directory from an earlier persistence
version to the current persistence version. The syntax for this mode is:

::

   RDFox [-server-directory <value>] [-persistence.encryption.key <value>] upgrade

See :numref:`persistence-upgrade` for general considerations around upgrade.

.. _exe-mode-daemon:

``daemon``
~~~~~~~~~~

``daemon`` mode launches an in-memory or persistent RDFox server for REST
interaction only, with defaults suitable for production. The syntax for this
mode is:

::

   RDFox [-<serverParameter> <value> ...] [-<endpointParameter> <value> ...] [-role <role>] [-password <password>] daemon [<root> [<command> ...]]


If the ``server-directory`` parameter is not specified in the command, the
default value for the OS user account is used (see above). To launch a
persistent server in this mode, the server directory must first have been
initialized using ``init`` mode (see the preceding section). To launch an
in-memory server, the ``persistence`` server parameter must be left unspecified
or set to ``off`` (in either the command line arguments or server parameters
file).

A role and password are required by this mode only if the server is in-memory
only (not persistent). If either the role of the password is absent from the
command arguments and environment variables, RDFox will exit with an error.

At this point, the server is started and any persisted data stores loaded. If
the command line includes any shell commands (in-memory servers only), an RDFox
shell is created to run them and then immediately closed. Finally the endpoint
is started. The process will run until it receives ``SIGINT`` or ``SIGTERM``
which will cause the endpoint to shutdown, disconnecting all clients
gracefully. Note that, on Unix Systems, ``SIGINT`` can be sent to a process
attached to a terminal by pressing Ctrl-C.

.. container:: example

   **Example: Launching a Daemon Process**

   The following Bash-compatible command line can be used to start a daemon
   mode process for REST access to the server initialized in the ``init`` mode
   example:

   ::

      RDFox -server-directory /var/lib/RDFox daemon

``shell``
~~~~~~~~~

``shell`` mode launches an in-memory or persistent RDFox server for command
line and, optionally, REST interaction, with defaults suitable for production.
The syntax for this mode is:

::

   RDFox [-<serverParameter> <value> ...] [-<endpointParameter> <value> ...] [-role <role>] [-password <password>] shell [<root> [<command> ...]]


If the ``server-directory`` parameter is not specified in the command, the
default value for the OS user account is used (see above). To launch a
persistent server in this mode, the server directory must first have been
initialized using ``init`` mode (see the preceding section). To launch an
in-memory server, the ``persistence`` server parameter must be left unspecified
or set to ``off`` (in either the command line arguments or server parameters
file).

A role and password are required by this mode in order to create the first
server role for an in-memory server, and to login to the shell for both
in-memory and persistent servers. If either the role or the password is absent
from the command arguments and environment variables RDFox will prompt for the
missing values to be given interactively.

At this point, the server is started and any persisted data stores loaded. An
RDFox shell is then created and the user is logged in with the supplied
credentials. If the command line includes any shell commands, these are
executed by the shell before the command prompt is returned for user
interaction. The shell can be closed by issuing the ``quit`` command.

.. container:: example

   **Example: Launching a Local Shell**

   The following command line can be used to launch a local shell connected to
   the server initialized in the ``init`` mode example:

   ::

      RDFox -server-directory /var/lib/RDFox shell

.. _remote-shell-client:

``remote``
~~~~~~~~~~

``remote`` mode launches a client for the remote shell API to provide command
line interaction with an RDFox server. The server's endpoint must be running
and reachable from the host running the ``remote`` mode process. The syntax for
this mode is:

::

   RDFox [-<remoteShellParameter> <value> ...] [-role <role>] [-password <password>] remote <server-url> [<command> ...]

The resulting process will call the remote shell API of the server at
``<server-url>`` to instantiate a remote shell instance, which will be used to
run any commands supplied on the command line, and then prompt for further
commands to run.

The remote shell client can be configured with zero or more parameters, each of
which is specified as a key-value pair of the form ``-<remoteShellParameter>
<value>``. The following table describes all available remote shell parameters.

A role name and password are required at startup. RDFox will first look for the
arguments ``-role <role>`` and ``-password <password>``. If one or both of
these options is missing, RDFox will next inspect the ``RDFOX_ROLE`` and
``RDFOX_PASSWORD`` environment variables respectively. If after this one or
both variables remain unset, RDFox will prompt for the missing information.

When invoked from the remote shell, commands will operate in exactly the same
way as if they were invoked from the local shell (``shell`` and ``sandbox``
modes) save for the exceptions documented in
:numref:`REST-remote-shell-limitations`. Interruptible operations may be
interrupted with Ctrl-C just as in local shells.

File paths embedded within commands are always interpreted with respect to the
server's file system. The remote shell client does not provide any way of using
the client's file system (unless the client is running on the same host as the
server).

Uniquely, as ``remote`` mode does not create an RDFox server instance, no
license key is required to use the RDFox executable in this mode.

.. container:: example

   **Example: Launching a Remote Shell**

   To connect to a server reachable at http://example.com:12110, run:
   
   ::

      RDFox remote http://example.com:12110

``service``
~~~~~~~~~~~

Manages RDFox as a background service. On UNIX platforms The syntax for this
mode is:

::

   RDFox service install [user | system] [-<serverParameter> <value> ...] [-<endpointParameter> <value> ...] [daemon [<root> [<command> ...]]]
   RDFox service uninstall [user | system]

On Windows, the syntax is:

::

   RDFox service install [system] [-<serverParameter> <value> ...] [-<endpointParameter> <value> ...] [daemon [<root> [<command> ...]]]
   RDFox service {uninstall | start | stop | reload} [system]

The ``install`` sub-command installs RDFox as a background service either for
the current user or for the system. On Windows, only system services are
supported. On macOS and Linux, the service is installed for the current user if
``system`` is not specified explicitly. Installing the service for the system
requires root or administrative privileges. On all platforms, arguments after
the optional ``user`` / ``system`` specification will be included in the
command to launch instances of the service. These must form a valid prefix for
a ``daemon`` mode command (see :numref:`exe-mode-daemon`).

The ``uninstall`` sub-command uninstalls the service, again requiring root or
administrator privileges in the case of system services.

On Windows, the ``start``, ``stop``, and ``reload`` sub-commands can be used to
start, stop, and reload the service respectively. On macOS and Linux,
instructions for managing the service are printed to the console when the
service is installed.

.. container:: example

   **Example: Installing and Uninstalling a System-Wide RDFox Service**

   To install RDFox as a system service using the server initialized in the
   ``init`` mode example, run:
   
   ::

      RDFox service install system -server-directory /var/lib/RDFox

   Read the instructions printed to the console for how to start, stop, and
   reload the service. To uninstall the service, run:

   ::

      RDFox service uninstall system
